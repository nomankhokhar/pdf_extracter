Foundation Support OpenStax College is grateful for the tremendous support of our sponsors. Without their strong engagement, the goal of free access to high-quality textbooks would remain just a dream. Laura and John Arnold Foundation (LJAF) actively seeks opportunities to invest in organizations and thought leaders that have a sincere interest in implementing fundamental changes that not only yield immediate gains, but also repair broken systems for future generations. LJAF currently focuses its strategic investments on education, criminal justice, research integrity, and public accountability. The William and Flora Hewlett Foundation has been making grants since 1967 to help solve social and environmental problems at home and around the world. The Foundation concentrates its resources on activities in education, the environment, global development and population, performing arts, and philanthropy, and makes grants to support disadvantaged communities in the San Francisco Bay Area. Guided by the belief that every life has equal value, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation works to help all people lead healthy, productive lives. In developing countries, it focuses on improving people’s health with vaccines and other life-saving tools and giving them the chance to lift themselves out of hunger and extreme poverty. In the United States, it seeks to significantly improve education so that all young people have the opportunity to reach their full potential. Based in Seattle, Washington, the foundation is led by CEO Jeff Raikes and Co-chair William H. Gates Sr., under the direction of Bill and Melinda Gates and Warren Buffett. The Maxfield Foundation supports projects with potential for high impact in science, education, sustainability, and other areas of social importance. Our mission at the Twenty Million Minds Foundation is to grow access and success by eliminating unnecessary hurdles to affordability. We support the creation, sharing, and proliferation of more effective, more affordable educational content by leveraging disruptive technologies, open educational resources, and new models for collaboration between for-profit, nonprofit, and public entities.

Preface 5 IUPAC data and interactives TED talks Assessments That Reinforce Key Concepts In-chapter Examples walk students through problems by posing a question, stepping out a solution, and then asking students to practice the skill with a “Check Your Learning” component. The book also includes assessments at the end of each chapter so students can apply what they’ve learned through practice problems. Atom-First Alternate Sequencing Chemistry was conceived and written to fit a particular topical sequence, but it can be used flexibly to accommodate other course structures. Some instructors prefer to organize their course in a molecule-first or atom-first organization. For professors who use this approach, our OpenStax Chemistry textbook can be sequenced to fit this pedagogy. Please consider, however, that the chapters were not written to be completely independent, and that the proposed alternate sequence should be carefully considered for student preparation and textual consistency. We recommend these shifts in the table of contents structure if you plan to create a molecule/atom-first version of this text for your students: Chapter 1: Essential Ideas Chapter 2: Atoms, Molecules, and Ions Chapter 6: Electronic Structure and Periodic Properties of Elements Chapter 7: Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry Chapter 8: Advanced Theories of Covalent Bonding Chapter 3: Composition of Substances and Solutions Chapter 4: Stoichiometry of Chemical Reactions Chapter 5: Thermochemistry Chapter 9: Gases Chapter 10: Liquids and Solids Chapter 11: Solutions and Colloids Chapter 12: Kinetics Chapter 13: Fundamental Equilibrium Concepts Chapter 14: Acid-Base Equilibria Chapter 15: Equilibria of Other Reaction Classes Chapter 16: Thermodynamics Chapter 17: Electrochemistry Chapter 18: Representative Metals, Metalloids, and Nonmetals Chapter 19: Transition Metals and Coordination Chemistry Chapter 20: Organic Chemistry Chapter 21: Nuclear Chemistry Ancillaries OpenStax projects offer an array of ancillaries for students and instructors.

Chapter 1 | Essential Ideas 9 Chapter 1 Essential Ideas Figure 1.1 Chemical substances and processes are essential for our existence, providing sustenance, keeping us clean and healthy, fabricating electronic devices, enabling transportation, and much more. (credit “left”: modification of work by “vxla”/Flickr; credit “left middle”: modification of work by “the Italian voice”/Flickr; credit “right middle”: modification of work by Jason Trim; credit “right”: modification of work by “gosheshe”/Flickr) Chapter Outline 1.1 Chemistry in Context 1.2 Phases and Classification of Matter 1.3 Physical and Chemical Properties 1.4 Measurements 1.5 Measurement Uncertainty, Accuracy, and Precision 1.6 Mathematical Treatment of Measurement Results Introduction Your alarm goes off and, after hitting “snooze” once or twice, you pry yourself out of bed. You make a cup of coffee to help you get going, and then you shower, get dressed, eat breakfast, and check your phone for messages. On your way to school, you stop to fill your car’s gas tank, almost making you late for the first day of chemistry class. As you find a seat in the classroom, you read the question projected on the screen: “Welcome to class! Why should we study chemistry?” Do you have an answer? You may be studying chemistry because it fulfills an academic requirement, but if you consider your daily activities, you might find chemistry interesting for other reasons. Most everything you do and encounter during your day involves chemistry. Making coffee, cooking eggs, and toasting bread involve chemistry. The products you use—like soap and shampoo, the fabrics you wear, the electronics that keep you connected to your world, the gasoline that propels your car—all of these and more involve chemical substances and processes. Whether you are aware or not, chemistry is part of your everyday world. In this course, you will learn many of the essential principles underlying the chemistry of modern-day life. 

--- Page 18 ---
10 Chapter 1 | Essential Ideas 1.1 Chemistry in Context By the end of this module, you will be able to: Outline the historical development of chemistry • Provide examples of the importance of chemistry in everyday life • Describe the scientific method • Differentiate among hypotheses, theories, and laws • Provide examples illustrating macroscopic, microscopic, and symbolic domains • Throughout human history, people have tried to convert matter into more useful forms. Our Stone Age ancestors chipped pieces of flint into useful tools and carved wood into statues and toys. These endeavors involved changing the shape of a substance without changing the substance itself. But as our knowledge increased, humans began to change the composition of the substances as well—clay was converted into pottery, hides were cured to make garments, copper ores were transformed into copper tools and weapons, and grain was made into bread. Humans began to practice chemistry when they learned to control fire and use it to cook, make pottery, and smelt metals. Subsequently, they began to separate and use specific components of matter. A variety of drugs such as aloe, myrrh, and opium were isolated from plants. Dyes, such as indigo and Tyrian purple, were extracted from plant and animal matter. Metals were combined to form alloys—for example, copper and tin were mixed together to make brass—and more elaborate smelting techniques produced iron. Alkalis were extracted from ashes, and soaps were prepared by combining these alkalis with fats. Alcohol was produced by fermentation and purified by distillation. Attempts to understand the behavior of matter extend back for more than 2500 years. As early as the sixth century BC, Greek philosophers discussed a system in which water was the basis of all things. You may have heard of the Greek postulate that matter consists of four elements: earth, air, fire, and water. Subsequently, an amalgamation of chemical technologies and philosophical speculations were spread from Egypt, China, and the eastern Mediterranean by alchemists, who endeavored to transform “base metals” such as lead into “noble metals” like gold, and to create (Figure 1.2). elixirs to cure disease and extend life https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

Chapter 1 | Essential Ideas 11 Figure 1.2 This portrayal shows an alchemist’s workshop circa 1580. Although alchemy made some useful contributions to how to manipulate matter, it was not scientific by modern standards. (credit: Chemical Heritage Foundation) From alchemy came the historical progressions that led to modern chemistry: the isolation of drugs from natural sources, metallurgy, and the dye industry. Today, chemistry continues to deepen our understanding and improve our ability to harness and control the behavior of matter. This effort has been so successful that many people do not realize either the central position of chemistry among the sciences or the importance and universality of chemistry in daily life. Chemistry: The Central Science Chemistry is sometimes referred to as “the central science” due to its interconnectedness with a vast array of other STEM disciplines (STEM stands for areas of study in the science, technology, engineering, and math fields). Chemistry and the language of chemists play vital roles in biology, medicine, materials science, forensics, (Figure 1.3). environmental science, and many other fields The basic principles of physics are essential for understanding many aspects of chemistry, and there is extensive overlap between many subdisciplines within the two fields, such as chemical physics and nuclear chemistry. Mathematics, computer science, and information theory provide important tools that help us calculate, interpret, describe, and generally make sense of the chemical world. Biology and chemistry converge in biochemistry, which is crucial to understanding the many complex factors and processes that keep living organisms (such as us) alive. Chemical engineering, materials science, and nanotechnology combine chemical principles and empirical findings to produce useful substances, ranging from gasoline to fabrics to electronics. Agriculture, food science, veterinary science, and brewing and wine making help provide sustenance in the form of food and drink to the world’s population. Medicine, pharmacology, biotechnology, and botany identify and produce substances that help keep us healthy. Environmental science, geology, oceanography, and atmospheric science incorporate many chemical ideas to help us better understand and protect our physical world. Chemical ideas are used to help understand the universe in astronomy and cosmology.

12 Chapter 1 | Essential Ideas Figure 1.3 Knowledge of chemistry is central to understanding a wide range of scientific disciplines. This diagram shows just some of the interrelationships between chemistry and other fields. What are some changes in matter that are essential to daily life? Digesting and assimilating food, synthesizing polymers that are used to make clothing, containers, cookware, and credit cards, and refining crude oil into gasoline and other products are just a few examples. As you proceed through this course, you will discover many different examples of changes in the composition and structure of matter, how to classify these changes and how they occurred, their causes, the changes in energy that accompany them, and the principles and laws involved. As you learn about these things, you will be learning chemistry, the study of the composition, properties, and interactions of matter. The practice of chemistry is not limited to chemistry books or laboratories: It happens whenever someone is involved in changes in matter or in conditions that may lead to such changes. The Scientific Method Chemistry is a science based on observation and experimentation. Doing chemistry involves attempting to answer questions and explain observations in terms of the laws and theories of chemistry, using procedures that are accepted by the scientific community. There is no single route to answering a question or explaining an observation, but there is an aspect common to every approach: Each uses knowledge based on experiments that can be reproduced to verify the results. Some routes involve a hypothesis, a tentative explanation of observations that acts as a guide for gathering and checking information. We test a hypothesis by experimentation, calculation, and/or comparison with the experiments of others and then refine it as needed. Some hypotheses are attempts to explain the behavior that is summarized in laws. The laws of science summarize a vast number of experimental observations, and describe or predict some facet of the natural world. If such a hypothesis turns out to be capable of explaining a large body of experimental data, it can reach the status of a theory. Scientific theories are well-substantiated, comprehensive, testable explanations of particular aspects of nature. Theories are accepted because they provide satisfactory explanations, but they can be modified if new data become available. The path of discovery that leads from question and observation to law or hypothesis to theory, combined with experimental verification of the hypothesis and any necessary modification of the theory, is called the scientific (Figure 1.4). method https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

Chapter 1 | Essential Ideas 13 Figure 1.4 The scientific method follows a process similar to the one shown in this diagram. All the key components are shown, in roughly the right order. Scientific progress is seldom neat and clean: It requires open inquiry and the reworking of questions and ideas in response to findings. The Domains of Chemistry Chemists study and describe the behavior of matter and energy in three different domains: macroscopic, microscopic, and symbolic. These domains provide different ways of considering and describing chemical behavior. Macro is a Greek word that means “large.” The macroscopic domain is familiar to us: It is the realm of everyday things that are large enough to be sensed directly by human sight or touch. In daily life, this includes the food you eat and the breeze you feel on your face. The macroscopic domain includes everyday and laboratory chemistry, where we observe and measure physical and chemical properties, or changes such as density, solubility, and flammability. The microscopic domain of chemistry is almost always visited in the imagination. Micro also comes from Greek and means “small.” Some aspects of the microscopic domains are visible through a microscope, such as a magnified image of graphite or bacteria. Viruses, for instance, are too small to be seen with the naked eye, but when we’re suffering from a cold, we’re reminded of how real they are. However, most of the subjects in the microscopic domain of chemistry—such as atoms and molecules—are too small to be seen even with standard microscopes and often must be pictured in the mind. Other components of the microscopic domain include ions and electrons, protons and neutrons, and chemical bonds, each of which is far too small to see. This domain includes the individual metal atoms in a wire, the ions that compose a salt crystal, the changes in individual molecules that result in a color change, the conversion of nutrient molecules into tissue and energy, and the evolution of heat as bonds that hold atoms together are created. The symbolic domain contains the specialized language used to represent components of the macroscopic and microscopic domains. Chemical symbols (such as those used in the periodic table), chemical formulas, and chemical equations are part of the symbolic domain, as are graphs and drawings. We can also consider calculations as part of the symbolic domain. These symbols play an important role in chemistry because they help interpret the behavior of the macroscopic domain in terms of the components of the microscopic domain. One of the challenges for 

--- Page 22 ---
14 Chapter 1 | Essential Ideas students learning chemistry is recognizing that the same symbols can represent different things in the macroscopic and microscopic domains, and one of the features that makes chemistry fascinating is the use of a domain that must be imagined to explain behavior in a domain that can be observed. A helpful way to understand the three domains is via the essential and ubiquitous substance of water. That water is a liquid at moderate temperatures, will freeze to form a solid at lower temperatures, and boil to form a gas at higher (Figure 1.5) temperatures are macroscopic observations. But some properties of water fall into the microscopic domain—what we cannot observe with the naked eye. The description of water as comprised of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom, and the explanation of freezing and boiling in terms of attractions between these molecules, is within the microscopic arena. The formula H2O, which can describe water at either the macroscopic or microscopic levels, is an example of the symbolic domain. The abbreviations (g) for gas, (s) for solid, and (l) for liquid are also symbolic. Figure 1.5 (a) Moisture in the air, icebergs, and the ocean represent water in the macroscopic domain. (b) At the molecular level (microscopic domain), gas molecules are far apart and disorganized, solid water molecules are close together and organized, and liquid molecules are close together and disorganized. (c) The formula H2O symbolizes water, and (g), (s), and (l) symbolize its phases. Note that clouds are actually comprised of either very small liquid water droplets or solid water crystals; gaseous water in our atmosphere is not visible to the naked eye, although it may be sensed as humidity.

Chapter 1 | Essential Ideas 15 1.2 Phases and Classification of Matter By the end of this section, you will be able to: Describe the basic properties of each physical state of matter: solid, liquid, and gas • Define and give examples of atoms and molecules • Classify matter as an element, compound, homogeneous mixture, or heterogeneous mixture with • regard to its physical state and composition Distinguish between mass and weight • Apply the law of conservation of matter • Matter is defined as anything that occupies space and has mass, and it is all around us. Solids and liquids are more obviously matter: We can see that they take up space, and their weight tells us that they have mass. Gases are also matter; if gases did not take up space, a balloon would stay collapsed rather than inflate when filled with gas. (Figure 1.6). Solids, liquids, and gases are the three states of matter commonly found on earth A solid is rigid and possesses a definite shape. A liquid flows and takes the shape of a container, except that it forms a flat or slightly curved upper surface when acted upon by gravity. (In zero gravity, liquids assume a spherical shape.) Both liquid and solid samples have volumes that are very nearly independent of pressure. A gas takes both the shape and volume of its container. Figure 1.6 The three most common states or phases of matter are solid, liquid, and gas. A fourth state of matter, plasma, occurs naturally in the interiors of stars. A plasma is a gaseous state of matter that (Figure 1.7). contains appreciable numbers of electrically charged particles The presence of these charged particles imparts unique properties to plasmas that justify their classification as a state of matter distinct from gases. In addition to stars, plasmas are found in some other high-temperature environments (both natural and man-made), such as lightning strikes, certain television screens, and specialized analytical instruments used to detect trace amounts of metals.

16 Chapter 1 | Essential Ideas Figure 1.7 A plasma torch can be used to cut metal. (credit: “Hypertherm”/Wikimedia Commons) Link to Learning In a tiny cell in a plasma television, the plasma emits ultraviolet light, which in turn causes the display at that location to appear a specific color. The composite of these tiny dots of color makes up the image that you see. Watch this video (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/16plasma) to learn more about plasma and the places you encounter it. Some samples of matter appear to have properties of solids, liquids, and/or gases at the same time. This can occur when the sample is composed of many small pieces. For example, we can pour sand as if it were a liquid because it is composed of many small grains of solid sand. Matter can also have properties of more than one state when it is a mixture, such as with clouds. Clouds appear to behave somewhat like gases, but they are actually mixtures of air (gas) and tiny particles of water (liquid or solid). The mass of an object is a measure of the amount of matter in it. One way to measure an object’s mass is to measure the force it takes to accelerate the object. It takes much more force to accelerate a car than a bicycle because the car has much more mass. A more common way to determine the mass of an object is to use a balance to compare its mass with a standard mass. Although weight is related to mass, it is not the same thing. Weight refers to the force that gravity exerts on an object. This force is directly proportional to the mass of the object. The weight of an object changes as the force of gravity changes, but its mass does not. An astronaut’s mass does not change just because she goes to the moon. But her weight on the moon is only one-sixth her earth-bound weight because the moon’s gravity is only one-sixth that of the earth’s. She may feel “weightless” during her trip when she experiences negligible external forces (gravitational or any other), although she is, of course, never “massless.” The law of conservation of matter summarizes many scientific observations about matter: It states that there is no detectable change in the total quantity of matter present when matter converts from one type to another (a chemical change) or changes among solid, liquid, or gaseous states (a physical change). Brewing beer and the operation of (Figure 1.8). batteries provide examples of the conservation of matter During the brewing of beer, the ingredients (water, yeast, grains, malt, hops, and sugar) are converted into beer (water, alcohol, carbonation, and flavoring substances) with no actual loss of substance. This is most clearly seen during the bottling process, when glucose turns https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

Chapter 1 | Essential Ideas 17 into ethanol and carbon dioxide, and the total mass of the substances does not change. This can also be seen in a lead-acid car battery: The original substances (lead, lead oxide, and sulfuric acid), which are capable of producing electricity, are changed into other substances (lead sulfate and water) that do not produce electricity, with no change in the actual amount of matter. Figure 1.8 (a) The mass of beer precursor materials is the same as the mass of beer produced: Sugar has become alcohol and carbonation. (b) The mass of the lead, lead oxide plates, and sulfuric acid that goes into the production of electricity is exactly equal to the mass of lead sulfate and water that is formed. Although this conservation law holds true for all conversions of matter, convincing examples are few and far between because, outside of the controlled conditions in a laboratory, we seldom collect all of the material that is produced during a particular conversion. For example, when you eat, digest, and assimilate food, all of the matter in the original food is preserved. But because some of the matter is incorporated into your body, and much is excreted as various types of waste, it is challenging to verify by measurement. Atoms and Molecules An atom is the smallest particle of an element that has the properties of that element and can enter into a chemical combination. Consider the element gold, for example. Imagine cutting a gold nugget in half, then cutting one of the halves in half, and repeating this process until a piece of gold remained that was so small that it could not be cut in half (regardless of how tiny your knife may be). This minimally sized piece of gold is an atom (from the Greek (Figure 1.9). atomos, meaning “indivisible”) This atom would no longer be gold if it were divided any further. 

--- Page 26 ---
18 Chapter 1 | Essential Ideas Figure 1.9 (a) This photograph shows a gold nugget. (b) A scanning-tunneling microscope (STM) can generate views of the surfaces of solids, such as this image of a gold crystal. Each sphere represents one gold atom. (credit a: modification of work by United States Geological Survey; credit b: modification of work by “Erwinrossen”/Wikimedia Commons) The first suggestion that matter is composed of atoms is attributed to the Greek philosophers Leucippus and Democritus, who developed their ideas in the 5th century BCE. However, it was not until the early nineteenth century that John Dalton (1766–1844), a British schoolteacher with a keen interest in science, supported this hypothesis with quantitative measurements. Since that time, repeated experiments have confirmed many aspects of this hypothesis, and it has become one of the central theories of chemistry. Other aspects of Dalton’s atomic theory are still used but with minor revisions (details of Dalton’s theory are provided in the chapter on atoms and molecules). An atom is so small that its size is difficult to imagine. One of the smallest things we can see with our unaided eye is a single thread of a spider web: These strands are about 1/10,000 of a centimeter (0.00001 cm) in diameter. Although the cross-section of one strand is almost impossible to see without a microscope, it is huge on an atomic scale. A single carbon atom in the web has a diameter of about 0.000000015 centimeter, and it would take about 7000 carbon atoms to span the diameter of the strand. To put this in perspective, if a carbon atom were the size of a dime, the cross-section of one strand would be larger than a football field, which would require about 150 million carbon atom (Figure 1.10) “dimes” to cover it. shows increasingly close microscopic and atomic-level views of ordinary cotton. Figure 1.10 These images provide an increasingly closer view: (a) a cotton boll, (b) a single cotton fiber viewed under an optical microscope (magnified 40 times), (c) an image of a cotton fiber obtained with an electron microscope (much higher magnification than with the optical microscope); and (d and e) atomic-level models of the fiber (spheres of different colors represent atoms of different elements).

Chapter 1 | Essential Ideas 19 An atom is so light that its mass is also difficult to imagine. A billion lead atoms (1,000,000,000 atoms) weigh about 10−13 × 3 grams, a mass that is far too light to be weighed on even the world’s most sensitive balances. It would 1014) × require over 300,000,000,000,000 lead atoms (300 trillion, or 3 to be weighed, and they would weigh only 0.0000001 gram. It is rare to find collections of individual atoms. Only a few elements, such as the gases helium, neon, and argon, consist of a collection of individual atoms that move about independently of one another. Other elements, such as the (Figure 1.11). gases hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, and chlorine, are composed of units that consist of pairs of atoms One form of the element phosphorus consists of units composed of four phosphorus atoms. The element sulfur exists in various forms, one of which consists of units composed of eight sulfur atoms. These units are called molecules. A molecule consists of two or more atoms joined by strong forces called chemical bonds. The atoms in a molecule move around as a unit, much like the cans of soda in a six-pack or a bunch of keys joined together on a single key ring. A molecule may consist of two or more identical atoms, as in the molecules found in the elements hydrogen, oxygen, and sulfur, or it may consist of two or more different atoms, as in the molecules found in water. Each water molecule is a unit that contains two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom. Each glucose molecule is a unit that contains 6 carbon atoms, 12 hydrogen atoms, and 6 oxygen atoms. Like atoms, molecules are incredibly small and light. If an ordinary glass of water were enlarged to the size of the earth, the water molecules inside it would be about the size of golf balls. Figure 1.11 The elements hydrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, and sulfur form molecules consisting of two or more atoms of the same element. The compounds water, carbon dioxide, and glucose consist of combinations of atoms of different elements. Classifying Matter We can classify matter into several categories. Two broad categories are mixtures and pure substances. A pure substance has a constant composition. All specimens of a pure substance have exactly the same makeup and properties. Any sample of sucrose (table sugar) consists of 42.1% carbon, 6.5% hydrogen, and 51.4% oxygen by mass. Any sample of sucrose also has the same physical properties, such as melting point, color, and sweetness, regardless of the source from which it is isolated. We can divide pure substances into two classes: elements and compounds. Pure substances that cannot be broken down into simpler substances by chemical changes are called elements. Iron, silver, gold, aluminum, sulfur, oxygen, and copper are familiar examples of the more than 100 known elements, of which about 90 occur naturally on the earth, and two dozen or so have been created in laboratories. Pure substances that can be broken down by chemical changes are called compounds. This breakdown may produce either elements or other compounds, or both. Mercury(II) oxide, an orange, crystalline solid, can be broken down by (Figure 1.12). heat into the elements mercury and oxygen When heated in the absence of air, the compound sucrose is broken down into the element carbon and the compound water. (The initial stage of this process, when the sugar is

Silver(I) chloride is a white solid that can be broken down into its elements, silver and chlorine, by absorption of light. This property is the basis for the use of this compound in photographic films and photochromic eyeglasses (those with lenses that darken when exposed to light). Figure 1.12 (a)The compound mercury(II) oxide, (b)when heated, (c) decomposes into silvery droplets of liquid mercury and invisible oxygen gas. (credit: modification of work by Paul Flowers) Link to Learning Many compounds break down when heated. This site (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/16mercury) shows the breakdown of mercury oxide, HgO. You can also view an example of the photochemical decomposition of silver chloride (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/16silvchloride) (AgCl), the basis of early photography. The properties of combined elements are different from those in the free, or uncombined, state. For example, white crystalline sugar (sucrose) is a compound resulting from the chemical combination of the element carbon, which is a black solid in one of its uncombined forms, and the two elements hydrogen and oxygen, which are colorless gases when uncombined. Free sodium, an element that is a soft, shiny, metallic solid, and free chlorine, an element that is a yellow-green gas, combine to form sodium chloride (table salt), a compound that is a white, crystalline solid. A mixture is composed of two or more types of matter that can be present in varying amounts and can be separated by physical changes, such as evaporation (you will learn more about this later). A mixture with a composition that varies from point to point is called a heterogeneous mixture. Italian dressing is an example of a heterogeneous mixture (Figure 1.13). Its composition can vary because we can make it from varying amounts of oil, vinegar, and herbs. It is not the same from point to point throughout the mixture—one drop may be mostly vinegar, whereas a different drop may be mostly oil or herbs because the oil and vinegar separate and the herbs settle. Other examples of heterogeneous mixtures are chocolate chip cookies (we can see the separate bits of chocolate, nuts, and cookie dough) and granite (we can see the quartz, mica, feldspar, and more). A homogeneous mixture, also called a solution, exhibits a uniform composition and appears visually the same throughout. An example of a solution is a sports drink, consisting of water, sugar, coloring, flavoring, and electrolytes (Figure 1.13). mixed together uniformly Each drop of a sports drink tastes the same because each drop contains the same amounts of water, sugar, and other components. Note that the composition of a sports drink can vary—it could be made with somewhat more or less sugar, flavoring, or other components, and still be a sports drink. Other examples of homogeneous mixtures include air, maple syrup, gasoline, and a solution of salt in water. https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

Each compound has a specific composition and possesses definite chemical and physical properties by which we can distinguish it from all other compounds. And, of course, there are innumerable ways to combine elements and compounds to form different mixtures. A summary of how to distinguish between the various major (Figure 1.14). classifications of matter is shown in Figure 1.14 Depending on its properties, a given substance can be classified as a homogeneous mixture, a heterogeneous mixture, a compound, or an element. (Table 1.1). Eleven elements make up about 99% of the earth’s crust and atmosphere Oxygen constitutes nearly one- half and silicon about one-quarter of the total quantity of these elements. A majority of elements on earth are found in chemical combinations with other elements; about one-quarter of the elements are also found in the free state.

Chapter 1 | Essential Ideas 23 Figure 1.15 The decomposition of water is shown at the macroscopic, microscopic, and symbolic levels. The battery provides an electric current (microscopic) that decomposes water. At the macroscopic level, the liquid separates into the gases hydrogen (on the left) and oxygen (on the right). Symbolically, this change is presented by showing how liquid H2O separates into H2 and O2 gases. The breakdown of water involves a rearrangement of the atoms in water molecules into different molecules, each composed of two hydrogen atoms and two oxygen atoms, respectively. Two water molecules form one oxygen molecule and two hydrogen molecules. The representation for what occurs, 2H2 O(l) ⟶2H2(g) + O2(g), will be explored in more depth in later chapters. The two gases produced have distinctly different properties. Oxygen is not flammable but is required for combustion of a fuel, and hydrogen is highly flammable and a potent energy source. How might this knowledge be applied in our world? One application involves research into more fuel-efficient transportation. Fuel-cell vehicles (FCV) run on hydrogen instead of gasoline (Figure 1.16). They are more efficient than vehicles with internal combustion engines, are nonpolluting, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, making us less dependent on fossil fuels. FCVs are not yet economically viable, however, and current hydrogen production depends on natural gas. If we can develop a process to economically decompose water, or produce hydrogen in another environmentally sound way, FCVs may be the way of the future.

Chemistry in Everyday Life Chemistry of Cell Phones Imagine how different your life would be without cell phones (Figure 1.17) and other smart devices. Cell phones are made from numerous chemical substances, which are extracted, refined, purified, and assembled using an extensive and in-depth understanding of chemical principles. About 30% of the elements that are found in nature are found within a typical smart phone. The case/body/frame consists of a combination of sturdy, durable polymers comprised primarily of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen [acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) and polycarbonate thermoplastics], and light, strong, structural metals, such as aluminum, magnesium, and iron. The display screen is made from a specially toughened glass (silica glass strengthened by the addition of aluminum, sodium, and potassium) and coated with a material to make it conductive (such as indium tin oxide). The circuit board uses a semiconductor material (usually silicon); commonly used metals like copper, tin, silver, and gold; and more unfamiliar elements such as yttrium, praseodymium, and gadolinium. The battery relies upon lithium ions and a variety of other materials, including iron, cobalt, copper, polyethylene oxide, and polyacrylonitrile. https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

A physical property is a characteristic of matter that is not associated with a change in its chemical composition. Familiar examples of physical properties include density, color, hardness, melting and boiling points, and electrical conductivity. We can observe some physical properties, such as density and color, without changing the physical state of the matter observed. Other physical properties, such as the melting temperature of iron or the freezing temperature of water, can only be observed as matter undergoes a physical change. A physical change is a change in the state or properties of matter without any accompanying change in its chemical composition (the identities of the substances contained in the matter). We observe a physical change when wax melts, when sugar dissolves in coffee, and when (Figure 1.18). steam condenses into liquid water Other examples of physical changes include magnetizing and demagnetizing metals (as is done with common antitheft security tags) and grinding solids into powders (which can sometimes yield noticeable changes in color). In each of these examples, there is a change in the physical state, form, or properties of the substance, but no change in its chemical composition.

(b) Steam condensing inside a cooking pot is a physical change, as water vapor is changed into liquid water. (credit a: modification of work by “95jb14”/Wikimedia Commons; credit b: modification of work by “mjneuby”/Flickr) The change of one type of matter into another type (or the inability to change) is a chemical property. Examples of chemical properties include flammability, toxicity, acidity, reactivity (many types), and heat of combustion. Iron, for (Figure 1.19). example, combines with oxygen in the presence of water to form rust; chromium does not oxidize Nitroglycerin is very dangerous because it explodes easily; neon poses almost no hazard because it is very unreactive. Figure 1.19 (a) One of the chemical properties of iron is that it rusts; (b) one of the chemical properties of chromium is that it does not. (credit a: modification of work by Tony Hisgett; credit b: modification of work by “Atoma”/Wikimedia Commons) To identify a chemical property, we look for a chemical change. A chemical change always produces one or more types of matter that differ from the matter present before the change. The formation of rust is a chemical change because rust is a different kind of matter than the iron, oxygen, and water present before the rust formed. The explosion of nitroglycerin is a chemical change because the gases produced are very different kinds of matter from the original substance. Other examples of chemical changes include reactions that are performed in a lab (such as copper (Figure reacting with nitric acid), all forms of combustion (burning), and food being cooked, digested, or rotting 1.20). https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

(b) During the combustion of a match, cellulose in the match and oxygen from the air undergo a chemical change to form carbon dioxide and water vapor. (c) Cooking red meat causes a number of chemical changes, including the oxidation of iron in myoglobin that results in the familiar red-to-brown color change. (d) A banana turning brown is a chemical change as new, darker (and less tasty) substances form. (credit b: modification of work by Jeff Turner; credit c: modification of work by Gloria Cabada-Leman; credit d: modification of work by Roberto Verzo) Properties of matter fall into one of two categories. If the property depends on the amount of matter present, it is an extensive property. The mass and volume of a substance are examples of extensive properties; for instance, a gallon of milk has a larger mass and volume than a cup of milk. The value of an extensive property is directly proportional to the amount of matter in question. If the property of a sample of matter does not depend on the amount of matter present, it is an intensive property. Temperature is an example of an intensive property. If the gallon and cup of milk are each at 20 °C (room temperature), when they are combined, the temperature remains at 20 °C. As another example, consider the distinct but related properties of heat and temperature. A drop of hot cooking oil spattered on your arm causes brief, minor discomfort, whereas a pot of hot oil yields severe burns. Both the drop and the pot of oil are at the same temperature (an intensive property), but the pot clearly contains much more heat (extensive property). Chemistry in Everyday Life Hazard Diamond You may have seen the symbol shown in Figure 1.21 on containers of chemicals in a laboratory or workplace. Sometimes called a “fire diamond” or “hazard diamond,” this chemical hazard diamond provides valuable 

--- Page 36 ---
28 Chapter 1 | Essential Ideas information that briefly summarizes the various dangers of which to be aware when working with a particular substance. Figure 1.21 The National Fire Protection Agency (NFPA) hazard diamond summarizes the major hazards of a chemical substance. The National Fire Protection Agency (NFPA) 704 Hazard Identification System was developed by NFPA to provide safety information about certain substances. The system details flammability, reactivity, health, and other hazards. Within the overall diamond symbol, the top (red) diamond specifies the level of fire hazard (temperature range for flash point). The blue (left) diamond indicates the level of health hazard. The yellow (right) diamond describes reactivity hazards, such as how readily the substance will undergo detonation or a violent chemical change. The white (bottom) diamond points out special hazards, such as if it is an oxidizer (which allows the substance to burn in the absence of air/oxygen), undergoes an unusual or dangerous reaction with water, is corrosive, acidic, alkaline, a biological hazard, radioactive, and so on. Each hazard is rated on a scale from 0 to 4, with 0 being no hazard and 4 being extremely hazardous. While many elements differ dramatically in their chemical and physical properties, some elements have similar properties. We can identify sets of elements that exhibit common behaviors. For example, many elements conduct heat and electricity well, whereas others are poor conductors. These properties can be used to sort the elements into three classes: metals (elements that conduct well), nonmetals (elements that conduct poorly), and metalloids (elements that have properties of both metals and nonmetals). (Figure 1.22). The periodic table is a table of elements that places elements with similar properties close together You will learn more about the periodic table as you continue your study of chemistry. https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

Note the background color denotes whether an element is a metal, metalloid, or nonmetal, whereas the element symbol color indicates whether it is a solid, liquid, or gas. 1.4 Measurements By the end of this section, you will be able to: Explain the process of measurement • Identify the three basic parts of a quantity • Describe the properties and units of length, mass, volume, density, temperature, and time • Perform basic unit calculations and conversions in the metric and other unit systems • Measurements provide the macroscopic information that is the basis of most of the hypotheses, theories, and laws that describe the behavior of matter and energy in both the macroscopic and microscopic domains of chemistry. Every measurement provides three kinds of information: the size or magnitude of the measurement (a number); a standard of comparison for the measurement (a unit); and an indication of the uncertainty of the measurement. While the number and unit are explicitly represented when a quantity is written, the uncertainty is an aspect of the measurement result that is more implicitly represented and will be discussed later. 

--- Page 38 ---
30 Chapter 1 | Essential Ideas The number in the measurement can be represented in different ways, including decimal form and scientific notation. Appendix B.) (Scientific notation is also known as exponential notation; a review of this topic can be found in For example, the maximum takeoff weight of a Boeing 777-200ER airliner is 298,000 kilograms, which can also be 105 × kg. The mass of the average mosquito is about 0.0000025 kilograms, which can be written as written as 2.98 10−6 × 2.5 kg. Units, such as liters, pounds, and centimeters, are standards of comparison for measurements. When we buy a 2-liter bottle of a soft drink, we expect that the volume of the drink was measured, so it is two times larger than the volume that everyone agrees to be 1 liter. The meat used to prepare a 0.25-pound hamburger is measured so it weighs one- fourth as much as 1 pound. Without units, a number can be meaningless, confusing, or possibly life threatening. Suppose a doctor prescribes phenobarbital to control a patient’s seizures and states a dosage of “100” without specifying units. Not only will this be confusing to the medical professional giving the dose, but the consequences can be dire: 100 mg given three times per day can be effective as an anticonvulsant, but a single dose of 100 g is more than 10 times the lethal amount. We usually report the results of scientific measurements in SI units, an updated version of the metric system, using Table 1.2. the units listed in Other units can be derived from these base units. The standards for these units are fixed by international agreement, and they are called the International System of Units or SI Units (from the French, Le Système International d’Unités). SI units have been used by the United States National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) since 1964. Base Units of the SI System Property Measured Name of Unit Symbol of Unit length meter m mass kilogram kg time second s temperature kelvin K electric current ampere A amount of substance mole mol luminous intensity candela cd Table 1.2 Sometimes we use units that are fractions or multiples of a base unit. Ice cream is sold in quarts (a familiar, non-SI base unit), pints (0.5 quart), or gallons (4 quarts). We also use fractions or multiples of units in the SI system, but these fractions or multiples are always powers of 10. Fractional or multiple SI units are named using a prefix and the name of the base unit. For example, a length of 1000 meters is also called a kilometer because the prefix kilo means 103 103 “one thousand,” which in scientific notation is (1 kilometer = 1000 m = m).

SI Base Units The initial units of the metric system, which eventually evolved into the SI system, were established in France during the French Revolution. The original standards for the meter and the kilogram were adopted there in 1799 and eventually by other countries. This section introduces four of the SI base units commonly used in chemistry. Other SI units will be introduced in subsequent chapters. Length The standard unit of length in both the SI and original metric systems is the meter (m). A meter was originally specified as 1/10,000,000 of the distance from the North Pole to the equator. It is now defined as the distance light (Figure 1.23); in a vacuum travels in 1/299,792,458 of a second. A meter is about 3 inches longer than a yard one 

--- Page 40 ---
32 Chapter 1 | Essential Ideas 103 meter is about 39.37 inches or 1.094 yards. Longer distances are often reported in kilometers (1 km = 1000 m = 10−2 m), whereas shorter distances can be reported in centimeters (1 cm = 0.01 m = m) or millimeters (1 mm = 0.001 10−3 m = m). Figure 1.23 The relative lengths of 1 m, 1 yd, 1 cm, and 1 in. are shown (not actual size), as well as comparisons of 2.54 cm and 1 in., and of 1 m and 1.094 yd. Mass The standard unit of mass in the SI system is the kilogram (kg). A kilogram was originally defined as the mass of a liter of water (a cube of water with an edge length of exactly 0.1 meter). It is now defined by a certain cylinder of (Figure 1.24). platinum-iridium alloy, which is kept in France Any object with the same mass as this cylinder is said to have a mass of 1 kilogram. One kilogram is about 2.2 pounds. The gram (g) is exactly equal to 1/1000 of the mass (10−3 of the kilogram kg). Figure 1.24 This replica prototype kilogram is housed at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in Maryland.

Chapter 1 | Essential Ideas 33 Temperature Temperature is an intensive property. The SI unit of temperature is the kelvin (K). The IUPAC convention is to use kelvin (all lowercase) for the word, K (uppercase) for the unit symbol, and neither the word “degree” nor the degree symbol (°). The degree Celsius (°C) is also allowed in the SI system, with both the word “degree” and the degree symbol used for Celsius measurements. Celsius degrees are the same magnitude as those of kelvin, but the two scales place their zeros in different places. Water freezes at 273.15 K (0 °C) and boils at 373.15 K (100 °C) by definition, and normal human body temperature is approximately 310 K (37 °C). The conversion between these two units and the Fahrenheit scale will be discussed later in this chapter. Time The SI base unit of time is the second (s). Small and large time intervals can be expressed with the appropriate 10−6 106 × × prefixes; for example, 3 microseconds = 0.000003 s = 3 and 5 megaseconds = 5,000,000 s = 5 s. Alternatively, hours, days, and years can be used. Derived SI Units We can derive many units from the seven SI base units. For example, we can use the base unit of length to define a unit of volume, and the base units of mass and length to define a unit of density. Volume Volume is the measure of the amount of space occupied by an object. The standard SI unit of volume is defined by (m3), (Figure 1.25). the base unit of length The standard volume is a cubic meter a cube with an edge length of exactly one meter. To dispense a cubic meter of water, we could build a cubic box with edge lengths of exactly one meter. This box would hold a cubic meter of water or any other substance. A more commonly used unit of volume is derived from the decimeter (0.1 m, or 10 cm). A cube with edge lengths of (dm3). exactly one decimeter contains a volume of one cubic decimeter A liter (L) is the more common name for the cubic decimeter. One liter is about 1.06 quarts. (cm3) A cubic centimeter is the volume of a cube with an edge length of exactly one centimeter. The abbreviation cc (for cubic centimeter) is often used by health professionals. A cubic centimeter is also called a milliliter (mL) and is 1/1000 of a liter.

(b) 1-cm3 The diameter of a dime is compared relative to the edge length of a (1-mL) cube. Density We use the mass and volume of a substance to determine its density. Thus, the units of density are defined by the base units of mass and length. The density of a substance is the ratio of the mass of a sample of the substance to its volume. The SI unit for density (kg/m3). is the kilogram per cubic meter For many situations, however, this as an inconvenient unit, and we often (g/cm3) use grams per cubic centimeter for the densities of solids and liquids, and grams per liter (g/L) for gases. g/cm3 Although there are exceptions, most liquids and solids have densities that range from about 0.7 (the density of g/cm3 Table 1.4 gasoline) to 19 (the density of gold).

Example 1.2 Using Displacement of Water to Determine Density PhET simulation (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/16phetmasvolden) This illustrates another way to determine density, using displacement of water. Determine the density of the red and yellow blocks. Solution When you open the density simulation and select Same Mass, you can choose from several 5.00-kg colored blocks that you can drop into a tank containing 100.00 L water. The yellow block floats (it is less dense than water), and the water level rises to 105.00 L. While floating, the yellow block displaces 5.00 L water, an amount equal to the weight of the block. The red block sinks (it is more dense than water, which has density = 1.00 kg/L), and the water level rises to 101.25 L. The red block therefore displaces 1.25 L water, an amount equal to the volume of the block. The density of the red block is: 5.00 kg mass density = = = 4.00 kg/L volume 1.25 L Note that since the yellow block is not completely submerged, you cannot determine its density from this information. But if you hold the yellow block on the bottom of the tank, the water level rises to 110.00 L, which means that it now displaces 10.00 L water, and its density can be found: 5.00 kg mass density = = = 0.500 kg/L 10.00 L volume Check Your Learning Remove all of the blocks from the water and add the green block to the tank of water, placing it approximately in the middle of the tank. Determine the density of the green block. Answer: 2.00 kg/L 1.5 Measurement Uncertainty, Accuracy, and Precision By the end of this section, you will be able to: Define accuracy and precision • Distinguish exact and uncertain numbers • Correctly represent uncertainty in quantities using significant figures • Apply proper rounding rules to computed quantities • Counting is the only type of measurement that is free from uncertainty, provided the number of objects being counted does not change while the counting process is underway. The result of such a counting measurement is an example of an exact number. If we count eggs in a carton, we know exactly how many eggs the carton contains. The numbers of defined quantities are also exact.

Chapter 1 | Essential Ideas 37 1 gram is exactly 0.001 kilogram. Quantities derived from measurements other than counting, however, are uncertain to varying extents due to practical limitations of the measurement process used. Significant Figures in Measurement The numbers of measured quantities, unlike defined or directly counted quantities, are not exact. To measure the volume of liquid in a graduated cylinder, you should make a reading at the bottom of the meniscus, the lowest point on the curved surface of the liquid. Figure 1.26 To measure the volume of liquid in this graduated cylinder, you must mentally subdivide the distance between the 21 and 22 mL marks into tenths of a milliliter, and then make a reading (estimate) at the bottom of the meniscus. Figure 1.26. Refer to the illustration in The bottom of the meniscus in this case clearly lies between the 21 and 22 markings, meaning the liquid volume is certainly greater than 21 mL but less than 22 mL. The meniscus appears to be a bit closer to the 22-mL mark than to the 21-mL mark, and so a reasonable estimate of the liquid’s volume would be 21.6 mL. In the number 21.6, then, the digits 2 and 1 are certain, but the 6 is an estimate. Some people might estimate the meniscus position to be equally distant from each of the markings and estimate the tenth-place digit as 5, while others may think it to be even closer to the 22-mL mark and estimate this digit to be 7. Note that it would be pointless to attempt to estimate a digit for the hundredths place, given that the tenths-place digit is uncertain. In general, numerical scales such as the one on this graduated cylinder will permit measurements to one-tenth of the smallest scale division. The scale in this case has 1-mL divisions, and so volumes may be measured to the nearest 0.1 mL. This concept holds true for all measurements, even if you do not actively make an estimate. If you place a quarter on a standard electronic balance, you may obtain a reading of 6.72 g. The digits 6 and 7 are certain, and the 2 indicates that the mass of the quarter is likely between 6.71 and 6.73 grams. The quarter weighs about 6.72 grams, with a nominal uncertainty in the measurement of ± 0.01 gram. If we weigh the quarter on a more sensitive balance, we may find that its mass is 6.723 g. This means its mass lies between 6.722 and 6.724 grams, an uncertainty of 0.001 gram. Every measurement has some uncertainty, which depends on the device used (and the user’s ability). All of the digits in 

--- Page 46 ---
38 Chapter 1 | Essential Ideas a measurement, including the uncertain last digit, are called significant figures or significant digits. Note that zero may be a measured value; for example, if you stand on a scale that shows weight to the nearest pound and it shows “120,” then the 1 (hundreds), 2 (tens) and 0 (ones) are all significant (measured) values. Whenever you make a measurement properly, all the digits in the result are significant. But what if you were analyzing a reported value and trying to determine what is significant and what is not? Well, for starters, all nonzero digits are significant, and it is only zeros that require some thought. We will use the terms “leading,” “trailing,” and “captive” for the zeros and will consider how to deal with them. Starting with the first nonzero digit on the left, count this digit and all remaining digits to the right. This is the number of significant figures in the measurement unless the last digit is a trailing zero lying to the left of the decimal point. Captive zeros result from measurement and are therefore always significant. Leading zeros, however, are never significant—they merely tell us where the decimal point is located. The leading zeros in this example are not significant. We could use exponential notation (as described in Appendix 10−3; × B) and express the number as 8.32407 then the number 8.32407 contains all of the significant figures, and 10−3 locates the decimal point. The number of significant figures is uncertain in a number that ends with a zero to the left of the decimal point location. The zeros in the measurement 1,300 grams could be significant or they could simply indicate where the 103 × (two decimal point is located. The ambiguity can be resolved with the use of exponential notation: 1.3 103 103 × × significant figures), 1.30 (three significant figures, if the tens place was measured), or 1.300 (four significant figures, if the ones place was also measured). In cases where only the decimal-formatted number is available, it is prudent to assume that all trailing zeros are not significant. When determining significant figures, be sure to pay attention to reported values and think about the measurement and significant figures in terms of what is reasonable or likely when evaluating whether the value makes sense. For example, the official January 2014 census reported the resident population of the US as 317,297,725. Do you think https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at 

--- Page 47 ---
Chapter 1 | Essential Ideas 39 the US population was correctly determined to the reported nine significant figures, that is, to the exact number of people? People are constantly being born, dying, or moving into or out of the country, and assumptions are made to account for the large number of people who are not actually counted. Because of these uncertainties, it might be more reasonable to expect that we know the population to within perhaps a million or so, in which case the population 108 × should be reported as 3.17 people. Significant Figures in Calculations A second important principle of uncertainty is that results calculated from a measurement are at least as uncertain as the measurement itself. We must take the uncertainty in our measurements into account to avoid misrepresenting the uncertainty in calculated results. One way to do this is to report the result of a calculation with the correct number of significant figures, which is determined by the following three rules for rounding numbers: When we add or subtract numbers, we should round the result to the same number of decimal places as the 1. number with the least number of decimal places (the least precise value in terms of addition and subtraction). When we multiply or divide numbers, we should round the result to the same number of digits as the number 2. with the least number of significant figures (the least precise value in terms of multiplication and division). If the digit to be dropped (the one immediately to the right of the digit to be retained) is less than 5, we “round 3. down” and leave the retained digit unchanged; if it is more than 5, we “round up” and increase the retained digit by 1; if the dropped digit is 5, we round up or down, whichever yields an even value for the retained digit. (The last part of this rule may strike you as a bit odd, but it’s based on reliable statistics and is aimed at avoiding any bias when dropping the digit “5,” since it is equally close to both possible values of the retained digit.) The following examples illustrate the application of this rule in rounding a few different numbers to three significant figures: 0.028675 rounds “up” to 0.0287 (the dropped digit, 7, is greater than 5) • 18.3384 rounds “down” to 18.3 (the dropped digit, 3, is lesser than 5) • 6.8752 rounds “up” to 6.88 (the dropped digit is 5, and the retained digit is even) • 92.85 rounds “down” to 92.8 (the dropped digit is 5, and the retained digit is even) • Let’s work through these rules with a few examples. Example 1.3 Rounding Numbers Round the following to the indicated number of significant figures: (a) 31.57 (to two significant figures) (b) 8.1649 (to three significant figures) (c) 0.051065 (to four significant figures) (d) 0.90275 (to four significant figures) Solution (a) 31.57 rounds “up” to 32 (the dropped digit is 5, and the retained digit is even) (b) 8.1649 rounds “down” to 8.16 (the dropped digit, 4, is lesser than 5) (c) 0.051065 rounds “down” to 0.05106 (the dropped digit is 5, and the retained digit is even) (d) 0.90275 rounds “up” to 0.9028 (the dropped digit is 5, and the retained digit is even)

Measurements are said to be precise if they yield very similar results when repeated in the same manner. A measurement is considered accurate if it yields a result that is very close to the true or accepted value. Precise values agree with each other; accurate values agree with a true value. These (Figure 1.27). characterizations can be extended to other contexts, such as the results of an archery competition Figure 1.27 (a) These arrows are close to both the bull’s eye and one another, so they are both accurate and precise. (b) These arrows are close to one another but not on target, so they are precise but not accurate.

She proceeds to use each machine to fill five bottles and then carefully determines the actual volume dispensed, obtaining Table 1.5. the results tabulated in Volume (mL) of Cough Medicine Delivered by 10-oz (296 mL) Dispensers Dispenser #1 Dispenser #2 Dispenser #3 283.3 298.3 296.1 284.1 294.2 295.9 283.9 296.0 296.1 284.0 297.8 296.0 284.1 293.9 296.1 Table 1.5 Considering these results, she will report that dispenser #1 is precise (values all close to one another, within a few tenths of a milliliter) but not accurate (none of the values are close to the target value of 296 mL, each being more than 10 mL too low). Results for dispenser #2 represent improved accuracy (each volume is less than 3 mL away from 296 mL) but worse precision (volumes vary by more than 4 mL). Finally, she can report that dispenser #3 is working well, dispensing cough syrup both accurately (all volumes within 0.1 mL of the target volume) and precisely (volumes differing from each other by no more than 0.2 mL). 1.6 Mathematical Treatment of Measurement Results By the end of this section, you will be able to: Explain the dimensional analysis (factor label) approach to mathematical calculations involving • quantities Use dimensional analysis to carry out unit conversions for a given property and computations • involving two or more properties It is often the case that a quantity of interest may not be easy (or even possible) to measure directly but instead must be calculated from other directly measured properties and appropriate mathematical relationships. For example, consider measuring the average speed of an athlete running sprints. This is typically accomplished by measuring the time required for the athlete to run from the starting line to the finish line, and the distance between these two lines, and then computing speed from the equation that relates these three properties: distance speed = time An Olympic-quality sprinter can run 100 m in approximately 10 s, corresponding to an average speed of 100 m = 10 m/s 10 s Note that this simple arithmetic involves dividing the numbers of each measured quantity to yield the number of the computed quantity (100/10 = 10) and likewise dividing the units of each measured quantity to yield the unit of the computed quantity (m/s = m/s). Now, consider using this same relation to predict the time required for a person https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at 

--- Page 53 ---
Chapter 1 | Essential Ideas 45 running at this speed to travel a distance of 25 m. The same relation between the three properties is used, but in this case, the two quantities provided are a speed (10 m/s) and a distance (25 m). To yield the sought property, time, the equation must be rearranged appropriately: distance time = speed The time can then be computed as: 25 m = 2.5 s 10 m/s Again, arithmetic on the numbers (25/10 = 2.5) was accompanied by the same arithmetic on the units (m/m/s = s) to yield the number and unit of the result, 2.5 s. Note that, just as for numbers, when a unit is divided by an identical unit (in this case, m/m), the result is “1”—or, as commonly phrased, the units “cancel.” These calculations are examples of a versatile mathematical approach known as dimensional analysis (or the factor- label method). Dimensional analysis is based on this premise: the units of quantities must be subjected to the same mathematical operations as their associated numbers. This method can be applied to computations ranging from simple unit conversions to more complex, multi-step calculations involving several different quantities. Conversion Factors and Dimensional Analysis A ratio of two equivalent quantities expressed with different measurement units can be used as a unit conversion factor. For example, the lengths of 2.54 cm and 1 in. are equivalent (by definition), and so a unit conversion factor may be derived from the ratio, 2.54 cm cm (2.54 cm = 1 in.) or 2.54 1 in. in. Table 1.6. Several other commonly used conversion factors are given in Common Conversion Factors Length Volume Mass 1 m = 1.0936 yd 1 L = 1.0567 qt 1 kg = 2.2046 lb 1 in. = 2.54 cm (exact) 1 qt = 0.94635 L 1 lb = 453.59 g 1 km = 0.62137 mi 1 (avoirdupois) oz = 28.349 g ft3 1 = 28.317 L 1 mi = 1609.3 m 1 tbsp = 14.787 mL 1 (troy) oz = 31.103 g Table 1.6 When we multiply a quantity (such as distance given in inches) by an appropriate unit conversion factor, we convert the quantity to an equivalent value with different units (such as distance in centimeters). For example, a basketball player’s vertical jump of 34 inches can be converted to centimeters by: 2.54 cm 34 in. × = 86 cm 1 in. Since this simple arithmetic involves quantities, the premise of dimensional analysis requires that we multiply both numbers and units. The numbers of these two quantities are multiplied to yield the number of the product quantity, 86, in. × cm whereas the units are multiplied to yield . Just as for numbers, a ratio of identical units is also numerically in. in. = 1, equal to one, and the unit product thus simplifies to cm. (When identical units divide to yield a factor of 1, in.

46 Chapter 1 | Essential Ideas they are said to “cancel.”) Using dimensional analysis, we can determine that a unit conversion factor has been set up correctly by checking to confirm that the original unit will cancel, and the result will contain the sought (converted) unit. Example 1.8 Using a Unit Conversion Factor The mass of a competition frisbee is 125 g. Convert its mass to ounces using the unit conversion factor (Table 1.6). derived from the relationship 1 oz = 28.349 g Solution If we have the conversion factor, we can determine the mass in kilograms using an equation similar the one used for converting length from inches to centimeters. x oz = 125 g × unit conversion factor We write the unit conversion factor in its two forms: 28.349 g 1 oz and 1 oz 28.35 g The correct unit conversion factor is the ratio that cancels the units of grams and leaves ounces. 1 oz x oz = 125 g × 28.349 g ⎛ ⎞ ⎝125 ⎠oz = 28.349 = 4.41 oz (three significant fig es) Check Your Learning Convert a volume of 9.345 qt to liters. Answer: 8.844 L Beyond simple unit conversions, the factor-label method can be used to solve more complex problems involving computations. Regardless of the details, the basic approach is the same—all the factors involved in the calculation must be appropriately oriented to insure that their labels (units) will appropriately cancel and/or combine to yield the desired unit in the result. This is why it is referred to as the factor-label method. As your study of chemistry continues, you will encounter many opportunities to apply this approach.

Answer: (a) 51 mpg; (b) $62 Conversion of Temperature Units We use the word temperature to refer to the hotness or coldness of a substance. One way we measure a change in temperature is to use the fact that most substances expand when their temperature increases and contract when their temperature decreases. The mercury or alcohol in a common glass thermometer changes its volume as the temperature changes. Because the volume of the liquid changes more than the volume of the glass, we can see the liquid expand when it gets warmer and contract when it gets cooler. To mark a scale on a thermometer, we need a set of reference values: Two of the most commonly used are the freezing and boiling temperatures of water at a specified atmospheric pressure. On the Celsius scale, 0 °C is defined as the freezing temperature of water and 100 °C as the boiling temperature of water. The space between the two temperatures is divided into 100 equal intervals, which we call degrees. On the Fahrenheit scale, the freezing point of water is defined as 32 °F and the boiling temperature as 212 °F. The space between these two points on a Fahrenheit thermometer is divided into 180 equal parts (degrees). Defining the Celsius and Fahrenheit temperature scales as described in the previous paragraph results in a slightly more complex relationship between temperature values on these two scales than for different units of measure for other properties. Most measurement units for a given property are directly proportional to one another (y = mx). Using familiar length units as one example: ⎛ ⎞ ⎝1 ft length in feet = ⎠× length in inches 12 in. where y = length in feet, x = length in inches, and the proportionality constant, m, is the conversion factor. The Celsius and Fahrenheit temperature scales, however, do not share a common zero point, and so the relationship between these two scales is a linear one rather than a proportional one (y = mx + b). Consequently, converting a temperature from one of these scales into the other requires more than simple multiplication by a conversion factor, m, it also must take into account differences in the scales’ zero points (b). The linear equation relating Celsius and Fahrenheit temperatures is easily derived from the two temperatures used to define each scale. Representing the Celsius temperature as x and the Fahrenheit temperature as y, the slope, m, is computed to be: Δy 9 °F 212 °F −32 °F 180 °F m = = = = Δx 100 °C −0 °C 100 °C 5 °C The y-intercept of the equation, b, is then calculated using either of the equivalent temperature pairs, (100 °C, 212 °F) or (0 °C, 32 °F), as: −9 °F b = y −mx = 32 °F × 0 °C = 32 °F 5 °C https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

Chapter 1 | Essential Ideas 49 The equation relating the temperature scales is then: ⎛ ⎞ ⎝9 °F ⎠+ 32 °C T°F = × T°C 5 °C An abbreviated form of this equation that omits the measurement units is: 9 T°F = × T°C + 32 5 Rearrangement of this equation yields the form useful for converting from Fahrenheit to Celsius: 5 ⎛ −32⎞ T°C = ⎝T°F ⎠ 9 As mentioned earlier in this chapter, the SI unit of temperature is the kelvin (K). Unlike the Celsius and Fahrenheit scales, the kelvin scale is an absolute temperature scale in which 0 (zero) K corresponds to the lowest temperature that can theoretically be achieved. The early 19th-century discovery of the relationship between a gas's volume and temperature suggested that the volume of a gas would be zero at −273.15 °C. In 1848, British physicist William Thompson, who later adopted the title of Lord Kelvin, proposed an absolute temperature scale based on this concept (further treatment of this topic is provided in this text’s chapter on gases). The freezing temperature of water on this scale is 273.15 K and its boiling temperature 373.15 K. Notice the numerical difference in these two reference temperatures is 100, the same as for the Celsius scale, and so the linear K 1 relation between these two temperature scales will exhibit a slope of . Following the same approach, the °C equations for converting between the kelvin and Celsius temperature scales are derived to be: TK = T°C + 273.15 T°C = TK −273.15 Figure 1.28 The 273.15 in these equations has been determined experimentally, so it is not exact. shows the relationship among the three temperature scales. Recall that we do not use the degree sign with temperatures on the kelvin scale.

50 Chapter 1 | Essential Ideas Figure 1.28 The Fahrenheit, Celsius, and kelvin temperature scales are compared. Although the kelvin (absolute) temperature scale is the official SI temperature scale, Celsius is commonly used in many scientific contexts and is the scale of choice for nonscience contexts in almost all areas of the world. Very few countries (the U.S. and its territories, the Bahamas, Belize, Cayman Islands, and Palau) still use Fahrenheit for weather, medicine, and cooking. Example 1.11 Conversion from Celsius Normal body temperature has been commonly accepted as 37.0 °C (although it varies depending on time of day and method of measurement, as well as among individuals).

Thus, it occupies a central place in the study and practice of science and technology. Chemists use the scientific method to perform experiments, pose hypotheses, and formulate laws and develop theories, so that they can better understand the behavior of the natural world. To do so, they operate in the macroscopic, microscopic, and symbolic domains. Chemists measure, analyze, purify, and synthesize a wide variety of substances that are important to our lives. 1.2 Phases and Classification of Matter Matter is anything that occupies space and has mass. The basic building block of matter is the atom, the smallest unit of an element that can enter into combinations with atoms of the same or other elements. In many substances, atoms are combined into molecules. On earth, matter commonly exists in three states: solids, of fixed shape and volume; liquids, of variable shape but fixed volume; and gases, of variable shape and volume. Under high-temperature conditions, matter also can exist as a plasma. Most matter is a mixture: It is composed of two or more types of matter that can be present in varying amounts and can be separated by physical means. Heterogeneous mixtures vary in composition from point to point; homogeneous mixtures have the same composition from point to point. Pure substances consist of only one type of matter. A pure substance can be an element, which consists of only one type of atom and cannot be broken down by a chemical change, or a compound, which consists of two or more types of atoms. 1.3 Physical and Chemical Properties All substances have distinct physical and chemical properties, and may undergo physical or chemical changes. Physical properties, such as hardness and boiling point, and physical changes, such as melting or freezing, do not involve a change in the composition of matter. Chemical properties, such flammability and acidity, and chemical changes, such as rusting, involve production of matter that differs from that present beforehand. Measurable properties fall into one of two categories. Extensive properties depend on the amount of matter present, for example, the mass of gold. Intensive properties do not depend on the amount of matter present, for example, the density of gold. Heat is an example of an extensive property, and temperature is an example of an intensive property. 1.4 Measurements Measurements provide quantitative information that is critical in studying and practicing chemistry. Each measurement has an amount, a unit for comparison, and an uncertainty. Measurements can be represented in either decimal or scientific notation. Scientists primarily use the SI (International System) or metric systems. We use base g/cm3 SI units such as meters, seconds, and kilograms, as well as derived units, such as liters (for volume) and (for https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

Chapter 1 | Essential Ideas 55 density). In many cases, we find it convenient to use unit prefixes that yield fractional and multiple units, such as (10−6 (106 microseconds seconds) and megahertz hertz), respectively. 1.5 Measurement Uncertainty, Accuracy, and Precision Quantities can be exact or measured. Measured quantities have an associated uncertainty that is represented by the number of significant figures in the measurement. The uncertainty of a calculated value depends on the uncertainties in the values used in the calculation and is reflected in how the value is rounded. Measured values can be accurate (close to the true value) and/or precise (showing little variation when measured repeatedly). 1.6 Mathematical Treatment of Measurement Results Measurements are made using a variety of units. It is often useful or necessary to convert a measured quantity from one unit into another. These conversions are accomplished using unit conversion factors, which are derived by simple applications of a mathematical approach called the factor-label method or dimensional analysis. This strategy is also employed to calculate sought quantities using measured quantities and appropriate mathematical relations. Exercises 1.1 Chemistry in Context 1.

Early detection of biomarkers, substances that indicate an organism’s disease or physiological state, could allow diagnosis and treatment before a condition becomes serious or irreversible. Recent studies have shown that your exhaled breath can contain molecules that may be biomarkers for recent exposure to environmental contaminants or for pathological conditions ranging from asthma to lung cancer. Scientists are working to develop biomarker “fingerprints” that could be used to diagnose a specific disease based on the amounts and identities of certain molecules in a patient’s exhaled breath. An essential concept underlying this goal is that of a molecule’s identity, which is determined by the numbers and types of atoms it contains, and how they are bonded together. This chapter will describe some of the fundamental chemical principles related to the composition of matter, including those central to the concept of molecular identity.

68 Chapter 2 | Atoms, Molecules, and Ions 2.1 Early Ideas in Atomic Theory By the end of this section, you will be able to: State the postulates of Dalton’s atomic theory • Use postulates of Dalton’s atomic theory to explain the laws of definite and multiple proportions • The language used in chemistry is seen and heard in many disciplines, ranging from medicine to engineering to forensics to art. The language of chemistry includes its own vocabulary as well as its own form of shorthand. Chemical symbols are used to represent atoms and elements. Chemical formulas depict molecules as well as the composition of compounds. Chemical equations provide information about the quality and quantity of the changes associated with chemical reactions. This chapter will lay the foundation for our study of the language of chemistry. The concepts of this foundation include the atomic theory, the composition and mass of an atom, the variability of the composition of isotopes, ion formation, chemical bonds in ionic and covalent compounds, the types of chemical reactions, and the naming of compounds. We will also introduce one of the most powerful tools for organizing chemical knowledge: the periodic table. Atomic Theory through the Nineteenth Century The earliest recorded discussion of the basic structure of matter comes from ancient Greek philosophers, the scientists of their day. In the fifth century BC, Leucippus and Democritus argued that all matter was composed of small, finite particles that they called atomos, a term derived from the Greek word for “indivisible.” They thought of atoms as moving particles that differed in shape and size, and which could join together. Later, Aristotle and others came to the conclusion that matter consisted of various combinations of the four “elements”—fire, earth, air, and water—and could be infinitely divided. Interestingly, these philosophers thought about atoms and “elements” as philosophical concepts, but apparently never considered performing experiments to test their ideas. The Aristotelian view of the composition of matter held sway for over two thousand years, until English schoolteacher John Dalton helped to revolutionize chemistry with his hypothesis that the behavior of matter could be explained using an atomic theory. First published in 1807, many of Dalton’s hypotheses about the microscopic features of matter are still valid in modern atomic theory. Here are the postulates of Dalton’s atomic theory. Matter is composed of exceedingly small particles called atoms. An atom is the smallest unit of an element 1. that can participate in a chemical change. An element consists of only one type of atom, which has a mass that is characteristic of the element and is the 2. (Figure 2.2). same for all atoms of that element A macroscopic sample of an element contains an incredibly large number of atoms, all of which have identical chemical properties. 1022 × Figure 2.2 A pre-1982 copper penny (left) contains approximately 3 copper atoms (several dozen are represented as brown spheres at the right), each of which has the same chemical properties.

Chapter 2 | Atoms, Molecules, and Ions 69 A compound consists of atoms of two or more elements combined in a small, whole-number ratio. In a given 4. (Figure 2.3). compound, the numbers of atoms of each of its elements are always present in the same ratio Figure 2.3 Copper(II) oxide, a powdery, black compound, results from the combination of two types of atoms—copper (brown spheres) and oxygen (red spheres)—in a 1:1 ratio. (credit: modification of work by “Chemicalinterest”/Wikimedia Commons) Atoms are neither created nor destroyed during a chemical change, but are instead rearranged to yield 5. (Figure 2.4). substances that are different from those present before the change Figure 2.4 When the elements copper (a shiny, red-brown solid, shown here as brown spheres) and oxygen (a clear and colorless gas, shown here as red spheres) react, their atoms rearrange to form a compound containing copper and oxygen (a powdery, black solid). (credit copper: modification of work by http://images- of-elements.com/copper.php) Dalton’s atomic theory provides a microscopic explanation of the many macroscopic properties of matter that you’ve learned about. For example, if an element such as copper consists of only one kind of atom, then it cannot be broken down into simpler substances, that is, into substances composed of fewer types of atoms. And if atoms are neither created nor destroyed during a chemical change, then the total mass of matter present when matter changes from one type to another will remain constant (the law of conservation of matter).

Does the following chemical change represented by these symbols violate any of the ideas of Dalton’s atomic theory? If so, which one? Solution The starting materials consist of two green spheres and two purple spheres. The products consist of only one green sphere and one purple sphere. This violates Dalton’s postulate that atoms are neither created nor destroyed during a chemical change, but are merely redistributed. (In this case, atoms appear to have been destroyed.) Check Your Learning In the following drawing, the green spheres represent atoms of a certain element. The purple spheres represent atoms of another element. If the spheres touch, they are part of a single unit of a compound. Does the following chemical change represented by these symbols violate any of the ideas of Dalton’s atomic theory? If so, which one? Answer: The starting materials consist of four green spheres and two purple spheres. The products consist of four green spheres and two purple spheres. This does not violate any of Dalton’s postulates: Atoms are neither created nor destroyed, but are redistributed in small, whole-number ratios. Dalton knew of the experiments of French chemist Joseph Proust, who demonstrated that all samples of a pure compound contain the same elements in the same proportion by mass. This statement is known as the law of definite proportions or the law of constant composition. The suggestion that the numbers of atoms of the elements in a given compound always exist in the same ratio is consistent with these observations. For example, when different samples of isooctane (a component of gasoline and one of the standards used in the octane rating system) are analyzed, they Table 2.1. are found to have a carbon-to-hydrogen mass ratio of 5.33:1, as shown in Constant Composition of Isooctane Sample Carbon Hydrogen Mass Ratio 5.33 g carbon 14.82 g carbon A 14.82 g 2.78 g = 1.00 g hydrogen 2.78 g hydrogen 22.33 g carbon 5.33 g carbon B 22.33 g 4.19 g = 4.19 g hydrogen 1.00 g hydrogen 19.40 g carbon 5.33 g carbon C 19.40 g 3.64 g = 1.00 g hydrogen 3.63 g hydrogen Table 2.1 https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

Chapter 2 | Atoms, Molecules, and Ions 71 It is worth noting that although all samples of a particular compound have the same mass ratio, the converse is not true in general. That is, samples that have the same mass ratio are not necessarily the same substance. For example, there are many compounds other than isooctane that also have a carbon-to-hydrogen mass ratio of 5.33:1.00. Dalton also used data from Proust, as well as results from his own experiments, to formulate another interesting law. The law of multiple proportions states that when two elements react to form more than one compound, a fixed mass of one element will react with masses of the other element in a ratio of small, whole numbers. For example, copper and chlorine can form a green, crystalline solid with a mass ratio of 0.558 g chlorine to 1 g copper, as well as a brown crystalline solid with a mass ratio of 1.116 g chlorine to 1 g copper. These ratios by themselves may not seem particularly interesting or informative; however, if we take a ratio of these ratios, we obtain a useful and possibly surprising result: a small, whole-number ratio. 1.116 g Cl 2 1 g Cu = 1 0.558 g Cl 1 g Cu This 2-to-1 ratio means that the brown compound has twice the amount of chlorine per amount of copper as the green compound. This can be explained by atomic theory if the copper-to-chlorine ratio in the brown compound is 1 copper atom to 2 chlorine atoms, and the ratio in the green compound is 1 copper atom to 1 chlorine atom. The ratio of chlorine atoms (Figure 2.5). (and thus the ratio of their masses) is therefore 2 to 1 Figure 2.5 Compared to the copper chlorine compound in (a), where copper is represented by brown spheres and chlorine by green spheres, the copper chlorine compound in (b) has twice as many chlorine atoms per copper atom.

A sample of compound B (also a clear, colorless gas) is analyzed and found to contain 5.19 g carbon and 13.84 g oxygen.

Much of this came from the results of several seminal experiments that revealed the details of the internal structure of atoms. Here, we will discuss some of those key developments, with an emphasis on application of the scientific method, as well as understanding how the experimental evidence was analyzed. While the historical persons and dates behind these experiments can be quite interesting, it is most important to understand the concepts resulting from their work. https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

Chapter 2 | Atoms, Molecules, and Ions 73 Atomic Theory after the Nineteenth Century If matter were composed of atoms, what were atoms composed of? Were they the smallest particles, or was there something smaller? In the late 1800s, a number of scientists interested in questions like these investigated the electrical discharges that could be produced in low-pressure gases, with the most significant discovery made by English physicist J. J. Thomson using a cathode ray tube. This apparatus consisted of a sealed glass tube from which almost all the air had been removed; the tube contained two metal electrodes. When high voltage was applied across the electrodes, a visible beam called a cathode ray appeared between them. This beam was deflected toward the positive charge and away from the negative charge, and was produced in the same way with identical properties when different metals were used for the electrodes. In similar experiments, the ray was simultaneously deflected by an applied magnetic field, and measurements of the extent of deflection and the magnetic field strength allowed Thomson to calculate the charge-to-mass ratio of the cathode ray particles. The results of these measurements (Figure 2.6). indicated that these particles were much lighter than atoms Figure 2.6 (a) J. J. Thomson produced a visible beam in a cathode ray tube. (b) This is an early cathode ray tube, invented in 1897 by Ferdinand Braun. (c) In the cathode ray, the beam (shown in yellow) comes from the cathode and is accelerated past the anode toward a fluorescent scale at the end of the tube. Simultaneous deflections by applied electric and magnetic fields permitted Thomson to calculate the mass-to-charge ratio of the particles composing the cathode ray. (credit a: modification of work by Nobel Foundation; credit b: modification of work by Eugen Nesper; credit c: modification of work by “Kurzon”/Wikimedia Commons) Based on his observations, here is what Thomson proposed and why: The particles are attracted by positive (+) charges and repelled by negative (−) charges, so they must be negatively charged (like charges repel and unlike charges attract); they are less massive than atoms and indistinguishable, regardless of the source material, so they must be fundamental, subatomic constituents of all atoms. Although controversial at the time, Thomson’s idea was gradually accepted, and his cathode ray particle is what we now call an electron, a negatively charged, subatomic

The term “electron” was coined in 1891 by Irish physicist George Stoney, from “electric ion.” Link to Learning Click here (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/16JJThomson) to hear Thomson describe his discovery in his own voice. In 1909, more information about the electron was uncovered by American physicist Robert A. Millikan via his “oil drop” experiments. Millikan created microscopic oil droplets, which could be electrically charged by friction as they formed or by using X-rays. These droplets initially fell due to gravity, but their downward progress could be slowed or even reversed by an electric field lower in the apparatus. By adjusting the electric field strength and making careful (Figure measurements and appropriate calculations, Millikan was able to determine the charge on individual drops 2.7). Figure 2.7 Millikan’s experiment measured the charge of individual oil drops. The tabulated data are examples of a few possible values. Looking at the charge data that Millikan gathered, you may have recognized that the charge of an oil droplet is always 10−19 × C. Millikan concluded that this value must therefore be a fundamental a multiple of a specific charge, 1.6 × charge—the charge of a single electron—with his measured charges due to an excess of one electron (1 times 1.6 10−19 10−19 10−19 × × C), two electrons (2 times 1.6 C), three electrons (3 times 1.6 C), and so on, on a given oil droplet.

However, the positively charged part of an atom was not yet well understood. In 1904, Thomson proposed the “plum pudding” model of atoms, which described a positively charged mass with an equal amount of negative charge in the form of electrons embedded in it, since all atoms are electrically neutral. A competing model had been proposed in 1903 by Hantaro Nagaoka, who postulated a Saturn-like atom, consisting of a positively charged sphere (Figure 2.8). surrounded by a halo of electrons Figure 2.8 (a) Thomson suggested that atoms resembled plum pudding, an English dessert consisting of moist cake with embedded raisins (“plums”). (b) Nagaoka proposed that atoms resembled the planet Saturn, with a ring of electrons surrounding a positive “planet.” (credit a: modification of work by “Man vyi”/Wikimedia Commons; credit b: modification of work by “NASA”/Wikimedia Commons) The next major development in understanding the atom came from Ernest Rutherford, a physicist from New Zealand who largely spent his scientific career in Canada and England. He performed a series of experiments using a beam of high-speed, positively charged alpha particles (α particles) that were produced by the radioactive decay of radium; α particles consist of two protons and two neutrons (you will learn more about radioactive decay in the chapter on nuclear chemistry). Rutherford and his colleagues Hans Geiger (later famous for the Geiger counter) and Ernest Marsden aimed a beam of α particles, the source of which was embedded in a lead block to absorb most of the radiation, at a very thin piece of gold foil and examined the resultant scattering of the α particles using a luminescent screen that glowed briefly where hit by an α particle. What did they discover? Most particles passed right through the foil without being deflected at all. However, some (Figure 2.9). were diverted slightly, and a very small number were deflected almost straight back toward the source Rutherford described finding these results: “It was quite the most incredible event that has ever happened to me in my life. It was almost as incredible as if you fired a 15-inch shell at a piece of tissue paper and it came back and hit you”[1] (p. 68). 1.

76 Chapter 2 | Atoms, Molecules, and Ions Figure 2.9 Geiger and Rutherford fired α particles at a piece of gold foil and detected where those particles went, as shown in this schematic diagram of their experiment. Most of the particles passed straight through the foil, but a few were deflected slightly and a very small number were significantly deflected. Here is what Rutherford deduced: Because most of the fast-moving α particles passed through the gold atoms undeflected, they must have traveled through essentially empty space inside the atom. Alpha particles are positively charged, so deflections arose when they encountered another positive charge (like charges repel each other). Since like charges repel one another, the few positively charged α particles that changed paths abruptly must have hit, or closely approached, another body that also had a highly concentrated, positive charge. Since the deflections occurred a small fraction of the time, this charge only occupied a small amount of the space in the gold foil. Analyzing a series of such experiments in detail, Rutherford drew two conclusions: The volume occupied by an atom must consist of a large amount of empty space. 1. A small, relatively heavy, positively charged body, the nucleus, must be at the center of each atom. 2. Link to Learning View this simulation (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/16Rutherford) of the Rutherford gold foil experiment. Adjust the slit width to produce a narrower or broader beam of α particles to see how that affects the scattering pattern. This analysis led Rutherford to propose a model in which an atom consists of a very small, positively charged nucleus, in which most of the mass of the atom is concentrated, surrounded by the negatively charged electrons, so that the (Figure 2.10). atom is electrically neutral After many more experiments, Rutherford also discovered that the nuclei of other elements contain the hydrogen nucleus as a “building block,” and he named this more fundamental particle the proton, the positively charged, subatomic particle found in the nucleus. With one addition, which you will learn next, this nuclear model of the atom, proposed over a century ago, is still used today. https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

Chapter 2 | Atoms, Molecules, and Ions 77 Figure 2.10 The α particles are deflected only when they collide with or pass close to the much heavier, positively charged gold nucleus. Because the nucleus is very small compared to the size of an atom, very few α particles are deflected. Most pass through the relatively large region occupied by electrons, which are too light to deflect the rapidly moving particles. Link to Learning The Rutherford Scattering simulation (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/ 16PhetScatter) allows you to investigate the differences between a “plum pudding” atom and a Rutherford atom by firing α particles at each type of atom. Another important finding was the discovery of isotopes. During the early 1900s, scientists identified several substances that appeared to be new elements, isolating them from radioactive ores. For example, a “new element” produced by the radioactive decay of thorium was initially given the name mesothorium. However, a more detailed analysis showed that mesothorium was chemically identical to radium (another decay product), despite having a different atomic mass. This result, along with similar findings for other elements, led the English chemist Frederick Soddy to realize that an element could have types of atoms with different masses that were chemically indistinguishable. These different types are called isotopes—atoms of the same element that differ in mass. Soddy was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1921 for this discovery. One puzzle remained: The nucleus was known to contain almost all of the mass of an atom, with the number of protons only providing half, or less, of that mass. Different proposals were made to explain what constituted the remaining mass, including the existence of neutral particles in the nucleus. As you might expect, detecting uncharged particles is very challenging, and it was not until 1932 that James Chadwick found evidence of neutrons, uncharged, subatomic particles with a mass approximately the same as that of protons. The existence of the neutron also

78 Chapter 2 | Atoms, Molecules, and Ions explained isotopes: They differ in mass because they have different numbers of neutrons, but they are chemically identical because they have the same number of protons. This will be explained in more detail later in this chapter. 2.3 Atomic Structure and Symbolism By the end of this section, you will be able to: Write and interpret symbols that depict the atomic number, mass number, and charge of an atom or • ion Define the atomic mass unit and average atomic mass • Calculate average atomic mass and isotopic abundance • The development of modern atomic theory revealed much about the inner structure of atoms. It was learned that an atom contains a very small nucleus composed of positively charged protons and uncharged neutrons, surrounded by a much larger volume of space containing negatively charged electrons. The nucleus contains the majority of an atom’s mass because protons and neutrons are much heavier than electrons, whereas electrons occupy almost all of an atom’s 10−10 10−15 volume. The diameter of an atom is on the order of m, whereas the diameter of the nucleus is roughly m—about 100,000 times smaller. For a perspective about their relative sizes, consider this: If the nucleus were the (Figure 2.11). size of a blueberry, the atom would be about the size of a football stadium Figure 2.11 If an atom could be expanded to the size of a football stadium, the nucleus would be the size of a single blueberry. (credit middle: modification of work by “babyknight”/Wikimedia Commons; credit right: modification of work by Paxson Woelber) Atoms—and the protons, neutrons, and electrons that compose them—are extremely small. For example, a carbon 10−23 10−19 × × atom weighs less than 2 g, and an electron has a charge of less than 2 C (coulomb). When describing the properties of tiny objects such as atoms, we use appropriately small units of measure, such as the atomic mass unit (amu) and the fundamental unit of charge (e). The amu was originally defined based on hydrogen, the lightest element, then later in terms of oxygen. Since 1961, it has been defined with regard to the most abundant isotope of carbon, atoms of which are assigned masses of exactly 12 amu. (This isotope is known as 1 of the mass of one carbon-12 “carbon-12” as will be discussed later in this module.) Thus, one amu is exactly 12 10−24 × g. (The Dalton (Da) and the unified atomic mass unit (u) are alternative units that atom: 1 amu = 1.6605 are equivalent to the amu.)

Chapter 2 | Atoms, Molecules, and Ions 79 A proton has a mass of 1.0073 amu and a charge of 1+. A neutron is a slightly heavier particle with a mass 1.0087 amu and a charge of zero; as its name suggests, it is neutral. The electron has a charge of 1−and is a much lighter particle with a mass of about 0.00055 amu (it would take about 1800 electrons to equal the mass of one proton. The properties Table 2.2. of these fundamental particles are summarized in (An observant student might notice that the sum of an atom’s subatomic particles does not equal the atom’s actual mass: The total mass of six protons, six neutrons, and six electrons is 12.0993 amu, slightly larger than 12.00 amu. This “missing” mass is known as the mass defect, and you will learn about it in the chapter on nuclear chemistry.)

This is the defining trait of an element: Its value determines the identity of the atom. For example, any atom that contains six protons is the element carbon and has the atomic number 6, regardless of how many neutrons or electrons it may have. A neutral atom must contain the same number of positive and negative charges, so the number of protons equals the number of electrons. Therefore, the atomic number also indicates the number of electrons in an atom. The total number of protons and neutrons in an atom is called its mass number (A). The number of neutrons is therefore the difference between the mass number and the atomic number: A – Z = number of neutrons. atomic number (Z) = number of protons atomic mass (A) = number of protons + number of neutrons A −Z = number of neutrons Atoms are electrically neutral if they contain the same number of positively charged protons and negatively charged electrons. When the numbers of these subatomic particles are not equal, the atom is electrically charged and is called an ion. The charge of an atom is defined as follows: Atomic charge = number of protons − number of electrons As will be discussed in more detail later in this chapter, atoms (and molecules) typically acquire charge by gaining or losing electrons. An atom that gains one or more electrons will exhibit a negative charge and is called an anion. Positively charged atoms called cations are formed when an atom loses one or more electrons. For example, a neutral sodium atom (Z = 11) has 11 electrons. If this atom loses one electron, it will become a cation with a 1+ charge (11 −10 = 1+). A neutral oxygen atom (Z = 8) has eight electrons, and if it gains two electrons it will become an anion with a 2− charge (8 − 10 = 2−).

(b) The addition of small amounts of iodine to salt, which prevents the formation of goiters, has helped eliminate this concern in the US where salt consumption is high. (credit a: modification of work by “Almazi”/Wikimedia Commons; credit b: modification of work by Mike Mozart) The addition of small amounts of iodine to table salt (iodized salt) has essentially eliminated this health concern in the United States, but as much as 40% of the world’s population is still at risk of iodine deficiency. The iodine atoms are added as anions, and each has a 1−charge and a mass number of 127. Determine the numbers of protons, neutrons, and electrons in one of these iodine anions. Solution The atomic number of iodine (53) tells us that a neutral iodine atom contains 53 protons in its nucleus and 53 electrons outside its nucleus. Because the sum of the numbers of protons and neutrons equals the mass number, 127, the number of neutrons is 74 (127 −53 = 74). Since the iodine is added as a 1−anion, the number of electrons is 128 [127 − (1−) = 128]. Check Your Learning An atom of platinum has a mass number of 195 and contains 74 electrons.

However, until the name is recognized by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC), the recommended name of the new element is based on the Latin word(s) for its atomic number. For example, element 106 was called unnilhexium (Unh), element 107 was called unnilseptium (Uns), and element 108 was called unniloctium (Uno) for several years. These elements are now named after scientists (or occasionally locations); for example, element 106 is now known as seaborgium (Sg) in honor of Glenn Seaborg, a Nobel Prize winner who was active in the discovery of several heavy elements.

Isotopes The symbol for a specific isotope of any element is written by placing the mass number as a superscript to the (Figure 2.14). left of the element symbol The atomic number is sometimes written as a subscript preceding the symbol, but since this number defines the element’s identity, as does its symbol, it is often omitted. For example, magnesium exists as a mixture of three isotopes, each with an atomic number of 12 and with mass numbers of 24, 24Mg, 25Mg, 26Mg. 25, and 26, respectively. These isotopes can be identified as and These isotope symbols are 24Mg read as “element, mass number” and can be symbolized consistent with this reading.

Atomic Mass Because each proton and each neutron contribute approximately one amu to the mass of an atom, and each electron contributes far less, the atomic mass of a single atom is approximately equal to its mass number (a whole number). However, the average masses of atoms of most elements are not whole numbers because most elements exist naturally as mixtures of two or more isotopes. The mass of an element shown in a periodic table or listed in a table of atomic masses is a weighted, average mass of all the isotopes present in a naturally occurring sample of that element. This is equal to the sum of each individual isotope’s mass multiplied by its fractional abundance. ∑ average mass = (fractional abundance × isotopic mass)i i 10B For example, the element boron is composed of two isotopes: About 19.9% of all boron atoms are with a mass of 11B 10.0129 amu, and the remaining 80.1% are with a mass of 11.0093 amu. The average atomic mass for boron is calculated to be: boron average mass = (0.199 × 10.0129 amu) + (0.801 × 11.0093 amu) = 1.99 amu + 8.82 amu = 10.81 amu It is important to understand that no single boron atom weighs exactly 10.8 amu; 10.8 amu is the average mass of all boron atoms, and individual boron atoms weigh either approximately 10 amu or 11 amu.

Analysis of a sample of the gas showed that it consisted 20Ne 21Ne 22Ne of 91.84% (mass 19.9924 amu), 0.47% (mass 20.9940 amu), and 7.69% (mass 21.9914 amu). What is the average mass of the neon in the solar wind? Solution average mass = (0.9184 × 19.9924 amu) + (0.0047 × 20.9940 amu) + (0.0769 × 21.9914 amu) = (18.36 + 0.099 + 1.69) amu = 20.15 amu The average mass of a neon atom in the solar wind is 20.15 amu.

Solution 35Cl 35Cl 37Cl The average mass of chlorine is the fraction that is times the mass of plus the fraction that is 37Cl. times the mass of 35 35 37 37 average mass = (fraction of Cl × mass of Cl) + (fraction of Cl × mass of Cl) 35Cl, 37Cl If we let x represent the fraction that is then the fraction that is is represented by 1.00 −x. 35Cl 37Cl 37Cl (The fraction that is + the fraction that is must add up to 1, so the fraction of must equal 1.00 35Cl.) − the fraction of Substituting this into the average mass equation, we have: 35.453 amu = (x × 34.96885 amu) + [(1.00 −x) × 36.96590 amu] 35.453 = 34.96885x + 36.96590 −36.96590x 1.99705x = 1.513 1.513 x = = 0.7576 1.99705 So solving yields: x = 0.7576, which means that 1.00 −0.7576 = 0.2424.

The occurrence and natural abundances of isotopes can be experimentally determined using an instrument called a mass spectrometer. Mass spectrometry (MS) is widely used in chemistry, forensics, medicine, environmental science, and many other fields to analyze and help identify the substances in a sample of material. In a typical (Figure 2.15), mass spectrometer the sample is vaporized and exposed to a high-energy electron beam that causes the sample’s atoms (or molecules) to become electrically charged, typically by losing one or more electrons. These cations then pass through a (variable) electric or magnetic field that deflects each cation’s path to an extent that depends on both its mass and charge (similar to how the path of a large steel ball bearing rolling past a magnet is deflected to a lesser extent that that of a small steel BB). The ions are detected, and a plot of the relative number of ions generated versus their mass-to-charge ratios (a mass spectrum) is made. The height of each vertical feature or peak in a mass spectrum is proportional to the fraction of cations with the specified mass-to-charge ratio. Since its initial use during the development of modern atomic theory, MS has evolved to become a powerful tool for chemical analysis in a wide range of applications.

(A subscript is used only when more than one atom of a given type is present.) Molecular formulas are also used as abbreviations for the names of compounds. The structural formula for a compound gives the same information as its molecular formula (the types and numbers of atoms in the molecule) but also shows how the atoms are connected in the molecule. The structural formula for (Figure methane contains symbols for one C atom and four H atoms, indicating the number of atoms in the molecule 2.16). The lines represent bonds that hold the atoms together. (A chemical bond is an attraction between atoms or ions that holds them together in a molecule or a crystal.) We will discuss chemical bonds and see how to predict the arrangement of atoms in a molecule later. For now, simply know that the lines are an indication of how the atoms are connected in a molecule. A ball-and-stick model shows the geometric arrangement of the atoms with atomic sizes not to scale, and a space-filling model shows the relative sizes of the atoms. Figure 2.16 A methane molecule can be represented as (a) a molecular formula, (b) a structural formula, (c) a ball- and-stick model, and (d) a space-filling model. Carbon and hydrogen atoms are represented by black and white spheres, respectively. Although many elements consist of discrete, individual atoms, some exist as molecules made up of two or more atoms of the element chemically bonded together. For example, most samples of the elements hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen are composed of molecules that contain two atoms each (called diatomic molecules) and thus have the molecular formulas H2, O2, and N2, respectively. Other elements commonly found as diatomic molecules are fluorine (F2), chlorine (Cl2), bromine (Br2), and iodine (I2). The most common form of the element sulfur is composed of (Figure 2.17). molecules that consist of eight atoms of sulfur; its molecular formula is S8 

--- Page 96 ---
88 Chapter 2 | Atoms, Molecules, and Ions Figure 2.17 A molecule of sulfur is composed of eight sulfur atoms and is therefore written as S8. It can be represented as (a) a structural formula, (b) a ball-and-stick model, and (c) a space-filling model. Sulfur atoms are represented by yellow spheres. It is important to note that a subscript following a symbol and a number in front of a symbol do not represent the same thing; for example, H2 and 2H represent distinctly different species. H2 is a molecular formula; it represents a diatomic molecule of hydrogen, consisting of two atoms of the element that are chemically bonded together. The expression 2H, on the other hand, indicates two separate hydrogen atoms that are not combined as a unit. The (Figure 2.18). expression 2H2 represents two molecules of diatomic hydrogen Figure 2.18 The symbols H, 2H, H2, and 2H2 represent very different entities. Compounds are formed when two or more elements chemically combine, resulting in the formation of bonds. For example, hydrogen and oxygen can react to form water, and sodium and chlorine can react to form table salt. We sometimes describe the composition of these compounds with an empirical formula, which indicates the types of atoms present and the simplest whole-number ratio of the number of atoms (or ions) in the compound. For example, titanium dioxide (used as pigment in white paint and in the thick, white, blocking type of sunscreen) has an empirical formula of TiO2. This identifies the elements titanium (Ti) and oxygen (O) as the constituents of titanium dioxide, (Figure and indicates the presence of twice as many atoms of the element oxygen as atoms of the element titanium 2.19). https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

(credit a: modification of work by “osseous”/Flickr) As discussed previously, we can describe a compound with a molecular formula, in which the subscripts indicate the actual numbers of atoms of each element in a molecule of the compound. In many cases, the molecular formula of a substance is derived from experimental determination of both its empirical formula and its molecular mass (the sum of atomic masses for all atoms composing the molecule). For example, it can be determined experimentally that benzene contains two elements, carbon (C) and hydrogen (H), and that for every carbon atom in benzene, there is one hydrogen atom. Thus, the empirical formula is CH. An experimental determination of the molecular mass reveals that a molecule of benzene contains six carbon atoms and six hydrogen atoms, so the molecular formula for benzene is (Figure 2.20). C6H6 Figure 2.20 Benzene, C6H6, is produced during oil refining and has many industrial uses. A benzene molecule can be represented as (a) a structural formula, (b) a ball-and-stick model, and (c) a space-filling model. (d) Benzene is a clear liquid. (credit d: modification of work by Sahar Atwa) If we know a compound’s formula, we can easily determine the empirical formula. (This is somewhat of an academic exercise; the reverse chronology is generally followed in actual practice.) For example, the molecular formula for acetic acid, the component that gives vinegar its sharp taste, is C2H4O2. This formula indicates that a molecule of (Figure 2.21) acetic acid contains two carbon atoms, four hydrogen atoms, and two oxygen atoms. The ratio of atoms is 2:4:2. Dividing by the lowest common denominator (2) gives the simplest, whole-number ratio of atoms, 1:2:1, so the empirical formula is CH2O. Note that a molecular formula is always a whole-number multiple of an empirical formula.

(credit: image courtesy of Lee Cronin) It is important to be aware that it may be possible for the same atoms to be arranged in different ways: Compounds with the same molecular formula may have different atom-to-atom bonding and therefore different structures. For example, could there be another compound with the same formula as acetic acid, C2H4O2? And if so, what would be the structure of its molecules? If you predict that another compound with the formula C2H4O2 could exist, then you demonstrated good chemical insight and are correct. Two C atoms, four H atoms, and two O atoms can also be arranged to form a methyl formate, which is used in manufacturing, as an insecticide, and for quick-drying finishes. Methyl formate molecules have one of the oxygen atoms between the two carbon atoms, differing from the arrangement in acetic acid molecules. Acetic acid and methyl formate are examples of isomers—compounds with the same chemical formula but different (Figure 2.23). molecular structures Note that this small difference in the arrangement of the atoms has a major effect on their respective chemical properties.

One such grouping includes lithium (Li), sodium (Na), and potassium (K): These elements all are shiny, conduct heat and electricity well, and have similar chemical properties. A second grouping includes calcium (Ca), strontium (Sr), and barium (Ba), which also are shiny, good conductors of heat and electricity, and have chemical properties in common. However, the specific properties of these two groupings are notably different from each other. For example: Li, Na, and K are much more reactive than are Ca, Sr, and Ba; Li, Na, and K form compounds with oxygen in a ratio of two of their atoms to one oxygen atom, whereas Ca, Sr, and Ba form compounds with one of their atoms to one oxygen atom. Fluorine (F), chlorine (Cl), bromine (Br), and iodine (I) also exhibit similar properties to each other, but these properties are drastically different from those of any of the elements above. Dimitri Mendeleev in Russia (1869) and Lothar Meyer in Germany (1870) independently recognized that there was a periodic relationship among the properties of the elements known at that time. Both published tables with the elements arranged according to increasing atomic mass. But Mendeleev went one step further than Meyer: He used his table to predict the existence of elements that would have the properties similar to aluminum and silicon, but were yet unknown. The discoveries of gallium (1875) and germanium (1886) provided great support for Mendeleev’s work. Although Mendeleev and Meyer had a long dispute over priority, Mendeleev’s contributions to the development of (Figure 2.25). the periodic table are now more widely recognized

94 Chapter 2 | Atoms, Molecules, and Ions Figure 2.25 (a) Dimitri Mendeleev is widely credited with creating (b) the first periodic table of the elements. (credit a: modification of work by Serge Lachinov; credit b: modification of work by “Den fjättrade ankan”/Wikimedia Commons) By the twentieth century, it became apparent that the periodic relationship involved atomic numbers rather than atomic masses. The modern statement of this relationship, the periodic law, is as follows: the properties of the elements are periodic functions of their atomic numbers. A modern periodic table arranges the elements in increasing (Figure 2.26). order of their atomic numbers and groups atoms with similar properties in the same vertical column Each box represents an element and contains its atomic number, symbol, average atomic mass, and (sometimes) name. The elements are arranged in seven horizontal rows, called periods or series, and 18 vertical columns, called groups. Groups are labeled at the top of each column. In the United States, the labels traditionally were numerals with capital letters. However, IUPAC recommends that the numbers 1 through 18 be used, and these labels are more common. For the table to fit on a single page, parts of two of the rows, a total of 14 columns, are usually written below the main body of the table. https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

Chapter 2 | Atoms, Molecules, and Ions 95 Figure 2.26 Elements in the periodic table are organized according to their properties. Many elements differ dramatically in their chemical and physical properties, but some elements are similar in their behaviors. For example, many elements appear shiny, are malleable (able to be deformed without breaking) and ductile (can be drawn into wires), and conduct heat and electricity well. Other elements are not shiny, malleable, or ductile, and are poor conductors of heat and electricity. We can sort the elements into large classes with common properties: metals (elements that are shiny, malleable, good conductors of heat and electricity—shaded yellow); nonmetals (elements that appear dull, poor conductors of heat and electricity—shaded green); and metalloids (elements that conduct heat and electricity moderately well, and possess some properties of metals and some properties of nonmetals—shaded purple). The elements can also be classified into the main-group elements (or representative elements) in the columns labeled 1, 2, and 13–18; the transition metals in the columns labeled 3–12; and inner transition metals in the two rows at the bottom of the table (the top-row elements are called lanthanides and the bottom-row elements are Figure 2.27). actinides; The elements can be subdivided further by more specific properties, such as the composition of the compounds they form. For example, the elements in group 1 (the first column) form compounds that consist of one atom of the element and one atom of hydrogen. These elements (except hydrogen) are known as alkali metals, and they all have similar chemical properties. The elements in group 2 (the second column) form compounds consisting of one atom of the element and two atoms of hydrogen: These are called alkaline earth metals, with similar properties among members of that group. Other groups with specific names are the pnictogens (group 15), chalcogens (group 16), halogens (group 17), and the noble gases (group 18, also known as inert gases). The groups

96 Chapter 2 | Atoms, Molecules, and Ions can also be referred to by the first element of the group: For example, the chalcogens can be called the oxygen group or oxygen family. Hydrogen is a unique, nonmetallic element with properties similar to both group 1A and group 7A elements. For that reason, hydrogen may be shown at the top of both groups, or by itself.

Element 43 (technetium), element 61 (promethium), and most of the elements with atomic number 84 (polonium) and higher have their atomic mass given in square brackets. This is done for elements that consist entirely of unstable, radioactive isotopes (you will learn more about radioactivity in the nuclear chemistry chapter). An average atomic weight cannot be determined for these elements because their radioisotopes may vary significantly in relative abundance, depending on the source, or may not even exist in nature. The number in square brackets is the atomic mass number (and approximate atomic mass) of the most stable isotope of that element. 2.6 Molecular and Ionic Compounds By the end of this section, you will be able to: Define ionic and molecular (covalent) compounds • Predict the type of compound formed from elements based on their location within the periodic table • Determine formulas for simple ionic compounds • In ordinary chemical reactions, the nucleus of each atom (and thus the identity of the element) remains unchanged. Electrons, however, can be added to atoms by transfer from other atoms, lost by transfer to other atoms, or shared with other atoms. The transfer and sharing of electrons among atoms govern the chemistry of the elements. During the formation of some compounds, atoms gain or lose electrons, and form electrically charged particles called ions (Figure 2.28). 

--- Page 106 ---
98 Chapter 2 | Atoms, Molecules, and Ions Figure 2.28 (a) A sodium atom (Na) has equal numbers of protons and electrons (11) and is uncharged. (b) A (Na+) sodium cation has lost an electron, so it has one more proton (11) than electrons (10), giving it an overall positive charge, signified by a superscripted plus sign. You can use the periodic table to predict whether an atom will form an anion or a cation, and you can often predict the charge of the resulting ion. Atoms of many main-group metals lose enough electrons to leave them with the same number of electrons as an atom of the preceding noble gas. To illustrate, an atom of an alkali metal (group 1) loses one electron and forms a cation with a 1+ charge; an alkaline earth metal (group 2) loses two electrons and forms a cation with a 2+ charge, and so on. For example, a neutral calcium atom, with 20 protons and 20 electrons, readily loses two electrons. This results in a cation with 20 protons, 18 electrons, and a 2+ charge. It has the same number of Ca2+. electrons as atoms of the preceding noble gas, argon, and is symbolized The name of a metal ion is the same as Ca2+ the name of the metal atom from which it forms, so is called a calcium ion. When atoms of nonmetal elements form ions, they generally gain enough electrons to give them the same number of electrons as an atom of the next noble gas in the periodic table. Atoms of group 17 gain one electron and form anions with a 1−charge; atoms of group 16 gain two electrons and form ions with a 2−charge, and so on. For example, the neutral bromine atom, with 35 protons and 35 electrons, can gain one electron to provide it with 36 electrons. This results in an anion with 35 protons, 36 electrons, and a 1−charge. It has the same number of electrons as atoms of the Br−. next noble gas, krypton, and is symbolized (A discussion of the theory supporting the favored status of noble gas electron numbers reflected in these predictive rules for ion formation is provided in a later chapter of this text.) (Figure 2.29). Note the usefulness of the periodic table in predicting likely ion formation and charge Moving from the far left to the right on the periodic table, main-group elements tend to form cations with a charge equal to the group number. That is, group 1 elements form 1+ ions; group 2 elements form 2+ ions, and so on. Moving from the far right to the left on the periodic table, elements often form anions with a negative charge equal to the number of groups moved left from the noble gases. For example, group 17 elements (one group left of the noble gases) form 1− ions; group 16 elements (two groups left) form 2−ions, and so on. This trend can be used as a guide in many cases, but its predictive value decreases when moving toward the center of the periodic table. In fact, transition metals and some other metals often exhibit variable charges that are not predictable by their location in the table. For example, copper can form ions with a 1+ or 2+ charge, and iron can form ions with a 2+ or 3+ charge. https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

Chapter 2 | Atoms, Molecules, and Ions 99 Figure 2.29 Some elements exhibit a regular pattern of ionic charge when they form ions. Example 2.8 Composition of Ions An ion found in some compounds used as antiperspirants contains 13 protons and 10 electrons. What is its symbol? Solution Because the number of protons remains unchanged when an atom forms an ion, the atomic number of the element must be 13. Knowing this lets us use the periodic table to identify the element as Al (aluminum). The Al atom has lost three electrons and thus has three more positive charges (13) than it has electrons (10).

100 Chapter 2 | Atoms, Molecules, and Ions Magnesium’s position in the periodic table (group 2) tells us that it is a metal. Metals form positive ions (cations). A magnesium atom must lose two electrons to have the same number electrons as an atom of the previous noble gas, neon. Thus, a magnesium atom will form a cation with two fewer electrons than protons Mg2+, and a charge of 2+. The symbol for the ion is and it is called a magnesium ion. Nitrogen’s position in the periodic table (group 15) reveals that it is a nonmetal. Nonmetals form negative ions (anions). A nitrogen atom must gain three electrons to have the same number of electrons as an atom of the following noble gas, neon. Thus, a nitrogen atom will form an anion with three more electrons than N3−, protons and a charge of 3−. The symbol for the ion is and it is called a nitride ion. Check Your Learning Aluminum and carbon react to form an ionic compound. Predict which forms an anion, which forms a cation, and the charges of each ion. Write the symbol for each ion and name them. Al3+, Answer: Al will form a cation with a charge of 3+: an aluminum ion. Carbon will form an anion with C4−, a charge of 4−: a carbide ion. The ions that we have discussed so far are called monatomic ions, that is, they are ions formed from only one atom. We also find many polyatomic ions. These ions, which act as discrete units, are electrically charged molecules (a Table 2.5. group of bonded atoms with an overall charge). Some of the more important polyatomic ions are listed in Oxyanions are polyatomic ions that contain one or more oxygen atoms. At this point in your study of chemistry, you should memorize the names, formulas, and charges of the most common polyatomic ions. Because you will use them repeatedly, they will soon become familiar.

NO3 SO4 corresponding to a given suffix or prefix is not consistent; for example, nitrate is sulfate is This will be covered in more detail in the next module on nomenclature. The nature of the attractive forces that hold atoms or ions together within a compound is the basis for classifying chemical bonding. When electrons are transferred and ions form, ionic bonds result. Ionic bonds are electrostatic forces of attraction, that is, the attractive forces experienced between objects of opposite electrical charge (in this case, cations and anions). When electrons are “shared” and molecules form, covalent bonds result. Covalent bonds are the attractive forces between the positively charged nuclei of the bonded atoms and one or more pairs of electrons that are located between the atoms. Compounds are classified as ionic or molecular (covalent) on the basis of the bonds present in them. Ionic Compounds When an element composed of atoms that readily lose electrons (a metal) reacts with an element composed of atoms that readily gain electrons (a nonmetal), a transfer of electrons usually occurs, producing ions. The compound formed by this transfer is stabilized by the electrostatic attractions (ionic bonds) between the ions of opposite charge present in the compound. For example, when each sodium atom in a sample of sodium metal (group 1) gives up one electron Na+, to form a sodium cation, and each chlorine atom in a sample of chlorine gas (group 17) accepts one electron to

The periodic table can help us recognize many of the compounds that are ionic: When a metal is combined with one or more nonmetals, the compound is usually ionic. This guideline works well for predicting ionic compound formation for most of the compounds typically encountered in an introductory chemistry course. However, it is not always true (for example, aluminum chloride, AlCl3, is not ionic). You can often recognize ionic compounds because of their properties. Ionic compounds are solids that typically melt at high temperatures and boil at even higher temperatures. For example, sodium chloride melts at 801 °C and boils at 1413 °C. (As a comparison, the molecular compound water melts at 0 °C and boils at 100 °C.) In solid form, an ionic compound is not electrically conductive because its ions are unable to flow (“electricity” is the flow of charged particles). When molten, however, it can conduct electricity because its ions are able to move freely through the liquid (Figure 2.30). Figure 2.30 Sodium chloride melts at 801 °C and conducts electricity when molten. (credit: modification of work by Mark Blaser and Matt Evans) Link to Learning Watch this video (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/16moltensalt) to see a mixture of salts melt and conduct electricity. In every ionic compound, the total number of positive charges of the cations equals the total number of negative charges of the anions. Thus, ionic compounds are electrically neutral overall, even though they contain positive and negative ions. We can use this observation to help us write the formula of an ionic compound. The formula of an ionic compound must have a ratio of ions such that the numbers of positive and negative charges are equal.

Figure 2.31 Although pure aluminum oxide is colorless, trace amounts of iron and titanium give blue sapphire its characteristic color. (credit: modification of work by Stanislav Doronenko) Solution Because the ionic compound must be electrically neutral, it must have the same number of positive and negative charges. Two aluminum ions, each with a charge of 3+, would give us six positive charges, and three oxide ions, each with a charge of 2−, would give us six negative charges. The formula would be Al2O3. Check Your Learning Na+, Predict the formula of the ionic compound formed between the sodium cation, and the sulfide anion, S2−. Answer: Na2S (Table 2.5) Many ionic compounds contain polyatomic ions as the cation, the anion, or both. As with simple ionic compounds, these compounds must also be electrically neutral, so their formulas can be predicted by treating the polyatomic ions as discrete units. We use parentheses in a formula to indicate a group of atoms that behave as a unit. For example, the formula for calcium phosphate, one of the minerals in our bones, is Ca3(PO4)2. This formula 3−) 3−groups (Ca2+) (PO4 PO4 indicates that there are three calcium ions for every two phosphate groups. The are discrete units, each consisting of one phosphorus atom and four oxygen atoms, and having an overall charge of 3−. The compound is electrically neutral, and its formula shows a total count of three Ca, two P, and eight O atoms. Example 2.11 Predicting the Formula of a Compound with a Polyatomic Anion Ca2+ Baking powder contains calcium dihydrogen phosphate, an ionic compound composed of the ions and −. H2 PO4 What is the formula of this compound? Solution The positive and negative charges must balance, and this ionic compound must be electrically neutral. Thus, we must have two negative charges to balance the 2+ charge of the calcium ion. This requires a ratio of one −ions. Ca2+ H2 PO4 ion to two We designate this by enclosing the formula for the dihydrogen phosphate ion in parentheses and adding a subscript 2. The formula is Ca(H2PO4)2.

Answer: Li2O2 Because an ionic compound is not made up of single, discrete molecules, it may not be properly symbolized using a molecular formula. Instead, ionic compounds must be symbolized by a formula indicating the relative numbers of its constituent cations. For compounds containing only monatomic ions (such as NaCl) and for many compounds containing polyatomic ions (such as CaSO4), these formulas are just the empirical formulas introduced earlier in this chapter. However, the formulas for some ionic compounds containing polyatomic ions are not empirical formulas. 2−ions Na+ C2 O4 combined in a 2:1 ratio, For example, the ionic compound sodium oxalate is comprised of and and its formula is written as Na2C2O4. The subscripts in this formula are not the smallest-possible whole numbers, as each can be divided by 2 to yield the empirical formula, NaCO2. This is not the accepted formula for sodium oxalate, 2−. C2 O4 however, as it does not accurately represent the compound’s polyatomic anion, Molecular Compounds Many compounds do not contain ions but instead consist solely of discrete, neutral molecules. These molecular compounds (covalent compounds) result when atoms share, rather than transfer (gain or lose), electrons. Covalent bonding is an important and extensive concept in chemistry, and it will be treated in considerable detail in a later chapter of this text. We can often identify molecular compounds on the basis of their physical properties. Under normal conditions, molecular compounds often exist as gases, low-boiling liquids, and low-melting solids, although many important exceptions exist. Whereas ionic compounds are usually formed when a metal and a nonmetal combine, covalent compounds are usually formed by a combination of nonmetals. Thus, the periodic table can help us recognize many of the compounds that are covalent. While we can use the positions of a compound’s elements in the periodic table to predict whether it is ionic or covalent at this point in our study of chemistry, you should be aware that this is a very simplistic approach that does not account for a number of interesting exceptions. Shades of gray exist between ionic and molecular compounds, and you’ll learn more about those later. Example 2.12 Predicting the Type of Bonding in Compounds Predict whether the following compounds are ionic or molecular: (a) KI, the compound used as a source of iodine in table salt (b) H2O2, the bleach and disinfectant hydrogen peroxide (c) CHCl3, the anesthetic chloroform (d) Li2CO3, a source of lithium in antidepressants Solution (a) Potassium (group 1) is a metal, and iodine (group 17) is a nonmetal; KI is predicted to be ionic.

This module describes an approach that is used to name simple ionic and molecular compounds, such as NaCl, CaCO3, and N2O4. The simplest of these are binary compounds, those containing only two elements, but we will also consider how to name ionic compounds containing polyatomic ions, and one specific, very important class of compounds known as acids (subsequent chapters in this text will focus on these compounds in great detail). We will limit our attention here to inorganic compounds, compounds that are composed principally of elements other than carbon, and will follow the nomenclature guidelines proposed by IUPAC. The rules for organic compounds, in which carbon is the principle element, will be treated in a later chapter on organic chemistry. Ionic Compounds To name an inorganic compound, we need to consider the answers to several questions. First, is the compound ionic or molecular? If the compound is ionic, does the metal form ions of only one type (fixed charge) or more than one type (variable charge)? Are the ions monatomic or polyatomic? If the compound is molecular, does it contain hydrogen? If so, does it also contain oxygen? From the answers we derive, we place the compound in an appropriate category and then name it accordingly. Compounds Containing Only Monatomic Ions The name of a binary compound containing monatomic ions consists of the name of the cation (the name of the metal) followed by the name of the anion (the name of the nonmetallic element with its ending replaced by the suffix –ide).

Compounds of these metals with nonmetals are named with the same method as compounds in the first category, except the charge of the metal ion is specified by a Roman numeral in parentheses after the name of the metal. The charge of the metal ion is determined from the formula of the compound and the charge of the anion. For example, consider binary ionic Figure 2.29), compounds of iron and chlorine. Iron typically exhibits a charge of either 2+ or 3+ (see and the two corresponding compound formulas are FeCl2 and FeCl3.

The settlement they won in 1996—$333 million—was the largest amount ever awarded for a direct-action lawsuit in the US at that time. Figure 2.32 (a) Erin Brockovich found that Cr(IV), used by PG&E, had contaminated the Hinckley, California, water supply. (b) The Cr(VI) ion is often present in water as the polyatomic ions chromate, 2−(left), 2−(right). CrO4 Cr2 O7 and dichromate, Chromium compounds are widely used in industry, such as for chrome plating, in dye-making, as preservatives, and to prevent corrosion in cooling tower water, as occurred near Hinckley. In the environment, chromium exists primarily in either the Cr(III) or Cr(VI) forms. Cr(III), an ingredient of many vitamin and nutritional supplements, forms compounds that are not very soluble in water, and it has low toxicity. But Cr(VI) is much more toxic and forms compounds that are reasonably soluble in water. Exposure to small amounts of Cr(VI) can lead to damage of the respiratory, gastrointestinal, and immune systems, as well as the kidneys, liver, blood, and skin. Despite cleanup efforts, Cr(VI) groundwater contamination remains a problem in Hinckley and other locations across the globe. A 2010 study by the Environmental Working Group found that of 35 US cities tested, 31 had

Molecular (Covalent) Compounds The bonding characteristics of inorganic molecular compounds are different from ionic compounds, and they are named using a different system as well. The charges of cations and anions dictate their ratios in ionic compounds, so specifying the names of the ions provides sufficient information to determine chemical formulas. However, because covalent bonding allows for significant variation in the combination ratios of the atoms in a molecule, the names for molecular compounds must explicitly identify these ratios. Compounds Composed of Two Elements When two nonmetallic elements form a molecular compound, several combination ratios are often possible. For example, carbon and oxygen can form the compounds CO and CO2. Since these are different substances with different properties, they cannot both have the same name (they cannot both be called carbon oxide). To deal with this situation, we use a naming method that is somewhat similar to that used for ionic compounds, but with added prefixes to specify the numbers of atoms of each element. The name of the more metallic element (the one farther to the left and/or bottom of the periodic table) is first, followed by the name of the more nonmetallic element (the one farther to the right and/or top) with its ending changed to the suffix –ide. The numbers of atoms of each element are designated by Table 2.10. the Greek prefixes shown in Nomenclature Prefixes Number Prefix Number Prefix 1 (sometimes omitted) mono- 6 hexa- 2 di- 7 hepta- 3 tri- 8 octa- 4 tetra- 9 nona- 5 penta- 10 deca- Table 2.10 When only one atom of the first element is present, the prefix mono- is usually deleted from that part. Thus, CO is named carbon monoxide, and CO2 is called carbon dioxide. When two vowels are adjacent, the a in the Greek prefix Table 2.11. is usually dropped.

112 Chapter 2 | Atoms, Molecules, and Ions Link to Learning The following website (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/16chemcompname) provides practice with naming chemical compounds and writing chemical formulas. You can choose binary, polyatomic, and variable charge ionic compounds, as well as molecular compounds. Binary Acids Some compounds containing hydrogen are members of an important class of substances known as acids. The chemistry of these compounds is explored in more detail in later chapters of this text, but for now, it will suffice to H+, note that many acids release hydrogen ions, when dissolved in water. To denote this distinct chemical property, a mixture of water with an acid is given a name derived from the compound’s name. If the compound is a binary acid (comprised of hydrogen and one other nonmetallic element): The word “hydrogen” is changed to the prefix hydro- 1. The other nonmetallic element name is modified by adding the suffix -ic 2. The word “acid” is added as a second word 3. For example, when the gas HCl (hydrogen chloride) is dissolved in water, the solution is called hydrochloric acid. Table 2.12. Several other examples of this nomenclature are shown in Names of Some Simple Acids Name of Gas Name of Acid HF(g), hydrogen fluoride HF(aq), hydrofluoric acid HCl(g), hydrogen chloride HCl(aq), hydrochloric acid HBr(g), hydrogen bromide HBr(aq), hydrobromic acid HI(g), hydrogen iodide HI(aq), hydroiodic acid H2S(g), hydrogen sulfide H2S(aq), hydrosulfuric acid Table 2.12 Oxyacids Many compounds containing three or more elements (such as organic compounds or coordination compounds) are subject to specialized nomenclature rules that you will learn later. However, we will briefly discuss the important compounds known as oxyacids, compounds that contain hydrogen, oxygen, and at least one other element, and are bonded in such a way as to impart acidic properties to the compound (you will learn the details of this in a later chapter). Typical oxyacids consist of hydrogen combined with a polyatomic, oxygen-containing ion. To name oxyacids: Omit “hydrogen” 1. Start with the root name of the anion 2. Replace –ate with –ic, or –ite with –ous 3. Add “acid” 4. https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

Chapter 2 | Atoms, Molecules, and Ions 113 For example, consider H2CO3 (which you might be tempted to call “hydrogen carbonate”). To name this correctly, “hydrogen” is omitted; the –ate of carbonate is replace with –ic; and acid is added—so its name is carbonic acid. Table 2.13. Other examples are given in There are some exceptions to the general naming method (e.g., H2SO4 is called sulfuric acid, not sulfic acid, and H2SO3 is sulfurous, not sulfous, acid).

Dalton postulated that each element has a characteristic type of atom that differs in properties from atoms of all other elements, and that atoms of different elements can combine in fixed, small, whole-number ratios to form compounds. Samples of a particular compound all have the same elemental proportions by mass. When two elements form different compounds, a given mass of one element will combine with masses of the other element in a small, whole-number ratio. During any chemical change, atoms are neither created nor destroyed. 2.2 Evolution of Atomic Theory Although no one has actually seen the inside of an atom, experiments have demonstrated much about atomic structure. Thomson’s cathode ray tube showed that atoms contain small, negatively charged particles called electrons. Millikan discovered that there is a fundamental electric charge—the charge of an electron. Rutherford’s gold foil experiment showed that atoms have a small, dense, positively charged nucleus; the positively charged particles within the nucleus are called protons. Chadwick discovered that the nucleus also contains neutral particles called neutrons. Soddy demonstrated that atoms of the same element can differ in mass; these are called isotopes. 2.3 Atomic Structure and Symbolism An atom consists of a small, positively charged nucleus surrounded by electrons. The nucleus contains protons and neutrons; its diameter is about 100,000 times smaller than that of the atom. The mass of one atom is usually expressed 1 of the mass of in atomic mass units (amu), which is referred to as the atomic mass. An amu is defined as exactly 12 10−24 × a carbon-12 atom and is equal to 1.6605 g. Protons are relatively heavy particles with a charge of 1+ and a mass of 1.0073 amu. Neutrons are relatively heavy particles with no charge and a mass of 1.0087 amu. Electrons are light particles with a charge of 1−and a mass of https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at 

--- Page 125 ---
Chapter 2 | Atoms, Molecules, and Ions 117 0.00055 amu. The number of protons in the nucleus is called the atomic number (Z) and is the property that defines an atom’s elemental identity. The sum of the numbers of protons and neutrons in the nucleus is called the mass number and, expressed in amu, is approximately equal to the mass of the atom. An atom is neutral when it contains equal numbers of electrons and protons. Isotopes of an element are atoms with the same atomic number but different mass numbers; isotopes of an element, therefore, differ from each other only in the number of neutrons within the nucleus. When a naturally occurring element is composed of several isotopes, the atomic mass of the element represents the average of the masses of the isotopes involved. A chemical symbol identifies the atoms in a substance using symbols, which are one-, two-, or three-letter abbreviations for the atoms. 2.4 Chemical Formulas A molecular formula uses chemical symbols and subscripts to indicate the exact numbers of different atoms in a molecule or compound. An empirical formula gives the simplest, whole-number ratio of atoms in a compound. A structural formula indicates the bonding arrangement of the atoms in the molecule. Ball-and-stick and space-filling models show the geometric arrangement of atoms in a molecule. Isomers are compounds with the same molecular formula but different arrangements of atoms. 2.5 The Periodic Table The discovery of the periodic recurrence of similar properties among the elements led to the formulation of the periodic table, in which the elements are arranged in order of increasing atomic number in rows known as periods and columns known as groups. Elements in the same group of the periodic table have similar chemical properties. Elements can be classified as metals, metalloids, and nonmetals, or as a main-group elements, transition metals, and inner transition metals. Groups are numbered 1–18 from left to right. The elements in group 1 are known as the alkali metals; those in group 2 are the alkaline earth metals; those in 15 are the pnictogens; those in 16 are the chalcogens; those in 17 are the halogens; and those in 18 are the noble gases. 2.6 Molecular and Ionic Compounds Metals (particularly those in groups 1 and 2) tend to lose the number of electrons that would leave them with the same number of electrons as in the preceding noble gas in the periodic table. By this means, a positively charged ion is formed. Similarly, nonmetals (especially those in groups 16 and 17, and, to a lesser extent, those in Group 15) can gain the number of electrons needed to provide atoms with the same number of electrons as in the next noble gas in the periodic table. Thus, nonmetals tend to form negative ions. Positively charged ions are called cations, and negatively charge ions are called anions. Ions can be either monatomic (containing only one atom) or polyatomic (containing more than one atom). Compounds that contain ions are called ionic compounds. Ionic compounds generally form from metals and nonmetals. Compounds that do not contain ions, but instead consist of atoms bonded tightly together in molecules (uncharged groups of atoms that behave as a single unit), are called covalent compounds. Covalent compounds usually form from two nonmetals. 2.7 Chemical Nomenclature Chemists use nomenclature rules to clearly name compounds. Ionic and molecular compounds are named using somewhat-different methods. Binary ionic compounds typically consist of a metal and a nonmetal. The name of the metal is written first, followed by the name of the nonmetal with its ending changed to –ide. For example, K2O is called potassium oxide. If the metal can form ions with different charges, a Roman numeral in parentheses follows the name of the metal to specify its charge. Thus, FeCl2 is iron(II) chloride and FeCl3 is iron(III) chloride. Some compounds contain polyatomic ions; the names of common polyatomic ions should be memorized. Molecular compounds can form compounds with different ratios of their elements, so prefixes are used to specify the numbers of atoms of each element in a molecule of the compound. Examples include SF6, sulfur hexafluoride, and N2O4, dinitrogen tetroxide. Acids are an important class of compounds containing hydrogen and having special nomenclature rules. Binary acids are named using the prefix hydro-, changing the –ide suffix to –ic, and adding

An element has the following natural abundances and isotopic masses: 90.92% abundance with 19.99 amu, 0.26% abundance with 20.99 amu, and 8.82% abundance with 21.99 amu.

(credit: modification of work by Vic Brincat) Chapter Outline 3.1 Formula Mass and the Mole Concept 3.2 Determining Empirical and Molecular Formulas 3.3 Molarity 3.4 Other Units for Solution Concentrations Introduction Swimming pools have long been a popular means of recreation, exercise, and physical therapy. Since it is impractical to refill large pools with fresh water on a frequent basis, pool water is regularly treated with chemicals to prevent the growth of harmful bacteria and algae. Proper pool maintenance requires regular additions of various chemical Ca2+, compounds in carefully measured amounts. For example, the relative amount of calcium ion, in the water should be maintained within certain limits to prevent eye irritation and avoid damage to the pool bed and plumbing. To maintain proper calcium levels, calcium cations are added to the water in the form of an ionic compound that also Ca2+ contains anions; thus, it is necessary to know both the relative amount of in the compound and the volume of water in the pool in order to achieve the proper calcium level. Quantitative aspects of the composition of substances (such as the calcium-containing compound) and mixtures (such as the pool water) are the subject of this chapter.

130 Chapter 3 | Composition of Substances and Solutions 3.1 Formula Mass and the Mole Concept By the end of this section, you will be able to: Calculate formula masses for covalent and ionic compounds • Define the amount unit mole and the related quantity Avogadro’s number Explain the relation • between mass, moles, and numbers of atoms or molecules, and perform calculations deriving these quantities from one another We can argue that modern chemical science began when scientists started exploring the quantitative as well as the qualitative aspects of chemistry. For example, Dalton’s atomic theory was an attempt to explain the results of measurements that allowed him to calculate the relative masses of elements combined in various compounds. Understanding the relationship between the masses of atoms and the chemical formulas of compounds allows us to quantitatively describe the composition of substances. Formula Mass In an earlier chapter, we described the development of the atomic mass unit, the concept of average atomic masses, and the use of chemical formulas to represent the elemental makeup of substances. These ideas can be extended to calculate the formula mass of a substance by summing the average atomic masses of all the atoms represented in the substance’s formula. Formula Mass for Covalent Substances For covalent substances, the formula represents the numbers and types of atoms composing a single molecule of the substance; therefore, the formula mass may be correctly referred to as a molecular mass. Consider chloroform (CHCl3), a covalent compound once used as a surgical anesthetic and now primarily used in the production of the “anti-stick” polymer, Teflon. The molecular formula of chloroform indicates that a single molecule contains one carbon atom, one hydrogen atom, and three chlorine atoms. The average molecular mass of a chloroform molecule is Figure 3.2 therefore equal to the sum of the average atomic masses of these atoms. outlines the calculations used to derive the molecular mass of chloroform, which is 119.37 amu. Figure 3.2 The average mass of a chloroform molecule, CHCl3, is 119.37 amu, which is the sum of the average atomic masses of each of its constituent atoms. The model shows the molecular structure of chloroform. Likewise, the molecular mass of an aspirin molecule, C9H8O4, is the sum of the atomic masses of nine carbon atoms, (Figure 3.3). eight hydrogen atoms, and four oxygen atoms, which amounts to 180.15 amu https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

Example 3.1 Computing Molecular Mass for a Covalent Compound Ibuprofen, C13H18O2, is a covalent compound and the active ingredient in several popular nonprescription pain medications, such as Advil and Motrin. What is the molecular mass (amu) for this compound? Solution Molecules of this compound are comprised of 13 carbon atoms, 18 hydrogen atoms, and 2 oxygen atoms. Following the approach described above, the average molecular mass for this compound is therefore: Check Your Learning Acetaminophen, C8H9NO2, is a covalent compound and the active ingredient in several popular nonprescription pain medications, such as Tylenol. What is the molecular mass (amu) for this compound? Answer: 151.16 amu Formula Mass for Ionic Compounds Ionic compounds are composed of discrete cations and anions combined in ratios to yield electrically neutral bulk matter. The formula mass for an ionic compound is calculated in the same way as the formula mass for covalent compounds: by summing the average atomic masses of all the atoms in the compound’s formula. Keep in mind, however, that the formula for an ionic compound does not represent the composition of a discrete molecule, so it may not correctly be referred to as the “molecular mass.” As an example, consider sodium chloride, NaCl, the chemical name for common table salt. Sodium chloride is an Na+, Cl−, ionic compound composed of sodium cations, and chloride anions, combined in a 1:1 ratio. The formula Figure 3.4). mass for this compound is computed as 58.44 amu (see 

--- Page 140 ---
132 Chapter 3 | Composition of Substances and Solutions Figure 3.4 Table salt, NaCl, contains an array of sodium and chloride ions combined in a 1:1 ratio. Its formula mass is 58.44 amu. Note that the average masses of neutral sodium and chlorine atoms were used in this computation, rather than the masses for sodium cations and chlorine anions. This approach is perfectly acceptable when computing the formula mass of an ionic compound. Even though a sodium cation has a slightly smaller mass than a sodium atom (since it is missing an electron), this difference will be offset by the fact that a chloride anion is slightly more massive than a chloride atom (due to the extra electron). Moreover, the mass of an electron is negligibly small with respect to the mass of a typical atom. Even when calculating the mass of an isolated ion, the missing or additional electrons can generally be ignored, since their contribution to the overall mass is negligible, reflected only in the nonsignificant digits that will be lost when the computed mass is properly rounded. The few exceptions to this guideline are very light ions derived from elements with precisely known atomic masses. Example 3.2 Computing Formula Mass for an Ionic Compound Aluminum sulfate, Al2(SO4)3, is an ionic compound that is used in the manufacture of paper and in various water purification processes. What is the formula mass (amu) of this compound? Solution Al3+ SO42−ions The formula for this compound indicates it contains and combined in a 2:3 ratio. For purposes of computing a formula mass, it is helpful to rewrite the formula in the simpler format, Al2S3O12. Following the approach outlined above, the formula mass for this compound is calculated as follows: Check Your Learning Calcium phosphate, Ca3(PO4)2, is an ionic compound and a common anti-caking agent added to food products.

Chapter 3 | Composition of Substances and Solutions 133 The Mole The identity of a substance is defined not only by the types of atoms or ions it contains, but by the quantity of each type of atom or ion. For example, water, H2O, and hydrogen peroxide, H2O2, are alike in that their respective molecules are composed of hydrogen and oxygen atoms. However, because a hydrogen peroxide molecule contains two oxygen atoms, as opposed to the water molecule, which has only one, the two substances exhibit very different properties. Today, we possess sophisticated instruments that allow the direct measurement of these defining microscopic traits; however, the same traits were originally derived from the measurement of macroscopic properties (the masses and volumes of bulk quantities of matter) using relatively simple tools (balances and volumetric glassware). This experimental approach required the introduction of a new unit for amount of substances, the mole, which remains indispensable in modern chemical science. The mole is an amount unit similar to familiar units like pair, dozen, gross, etc. It provides a specific measure of the number of atoms or molecules in a bulk sample of matter. A mole is defined as the amount of substance containing the same number of discrete entities (such as atoms, molecules, and ions) as the number of atoms in a sample of pure 12C weighing exactly 12 g. One Latin connotation for the word “mole” is “large mass” or “bulk,” which is consistent with its use as the name for this unit. The mole provides a link between an easily measured macroscopic property, bulk mass, and an extremely important fundamental property, number of atoms, molecules, and so forth. 1023, × a The number of entities composing a mole has been experimentally determined to be 6.02214179 fundamental constant named Avogadro’s number (NA) or the Avogadro constant in honor of Italian scientist Amedeo Avogadro. This constant is properly reported with an explicit unit of “per mole,” a conveniently rounded version 1023/mol. × being 6.022 Consistent with its definition as an amount unit, 1 mole of any element contains the same number of atoms as 1 mole of any other element. The masses of 1 mole of different elements, however, are different, since the masses of the individual atoms are drastically different. The molar mass of an element (or compound) is the mass in grams of 1 Figure 3.5). mole of that substance, a property expressed in units of grams per mole (g/mol) (see 1023 × Figure 3.5 Each sample contains 6.022 atoms —1.00 mol of atoms.

134 Chapter 3 | Composition of Substances and Solutions 12C, Because the definitions of both the mole and the atomic mass unit are based on the same reference substance, the molar mass of any substance is numerically equivalent to its atomic or formula weight in amu. Per the amu definition, 12C 12C a single atom weighs 12 amu (its atomic mass is 12 amu). According to the definition of the mole, 12 g of 12C contains 1 mole of atoms (its molar mass is 12 g/mol). This relationship holds for all elements, since their atomic 12C. masses are measured relative to that of the amu-reference substance, Extending this principle, the molar mass of (Figure 3.6). a compound in grams is likewise numerically equivalent to its formula mass in amu 1023 × Figure 3.6 Each sample contains 6.02 molecules or formula units—1.00 mol of the compound or element.

Explore more about the mole by reviewing the information under “Dig Deeper.” The relationships between formula mass, the mole, and Avogadro’s number can be applied to compute various quantities that describe the composition of substances and compounds. For example, if we know the mass and chemical composition of a substance, we can determine the number of moles and calculate number of atoms or molecules in the sample. Likewise, if we know the number of moles of a substance, we can derive the number of atoms or molecules and calculate the substance’s mass.

What is the estimated average requirement of potassium in moles? Solution The mass of K is provided, and the corresponding amount of K in moles is requested. Referring to the periodic table, the atomic mass of K is 39.10 amu, and so its molar mass is 39.10 g/mol. The given mass of

136 Chapter 3 | Composition of Substances and Solutions K (4.7 g) is a bit more than one-tenth the molar mass (39.10 g), so a reasonable “ballpark” estimate of the number of moles would be slightly greater than 0.1 mol.

Solution We can derive the number of moles of a compound from its mass following the same procedure we used for Example 3.3: an element in The molar mass of glycine is required for this calculation, and it is computed in the same fashion as its molecular mass.

It sends and receives signals to and from muscles and other internal organs to monitor and control their functions; it processes stimuli detected by sensory organs to guide interactions with the external world; and it houses the complex physiological processes that give rise to our intellect and emotions. The broad field of neuroscience spans all aspects of the structure and function of the central nervous system, including research on the anatomy and physiology of the brain. Great progress has been made in brain research over the past few decades, and the BRAIN Initiative, a federal initiative announced in 2013, aims to accelerate and capitalize on these advances through the concerted efforts of various industrial, academic, and government agencies (more details available at www.whitehouse.gov/share/brain-initiative).

(b) Information is transmitted in brain tissue and throughout the central nervous system by specialized cells called neurons (micrograph shows cells at 1600× magnification). Specialized cells called neurons transmit information between different parts of the central nervous system by way of electrical and chemical signals. Chemical signaling occurs at the interface between different neurons when one of the cells releases molecules (called neurotransmitters) that diffuse across the small gap between the cells (called the synapse) and bind to the surface of the other cell. These neurotransmitter molecules are stored in small intracellular structures called vesicles that fuse to the cell wall and then break open to release their contents when the neuron is appropriately stimulated. This process is called exocytosis (see Figure 3.10). https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

Chapter 3 | Composition of Substances and Solutions 141 One neurotransmitter that has been very extensively studied is dopamine, C8H11NO2. Dopamine is involved in various neurological processes that impact a wide variety of human behaviors. Dysfunctions in the dopamine systems of the brain underlie serious neurological diseases such as Parkinson’s and schizophrenia. Figure 3.10 (a) Chemical signals are transmitted from neurons to other cells by the release of neurotransmitter molecules into the small gaps (synapses) between the cells. (b) Dopamine, C8H11NO2, is a neurotransmitter involved in a number of neurological processes. One important aspect of the complex processes related to dopamine signaling is the number of neurotransmitter molecules released during exocytosis. Since this number is a central factor in determining neurological response (and subsequent human thought and action), it is important to know how this number changes with certain controlled stimulations, such as the administration of drugs. It is also important to understand the mechanism responsible for any changes in the number of neurotransmitter molecules released—for example, some dysfunction in exocytosis, a change in the number of vesicles in the neuron, or a change in the number of neurotransmitter molecules in each vesicle. Significant progress has been made recently in directly measuring the number of dopamine molecules stored in individual vesicles and the amount actually released when the vesicle undergoes exocytosis. Using miniaturized probes that can selectively detect dopamine molecules in very small amounts, scientists have determined that the vesicles of a certain type of mouse brain neuron contain an average of 30,000 dopamine 10−20 5 × molecules per vesicle (about mol or 50 zmol). Analysis of these neurons from mice subjected to various drug therapies shows significant changes in the average number of dopamine molecules contained in individual vesicles, increasing or decreasing by up to three-fold, depending on the specific drug used. These studies also indicate that not all of the dopamine in a given vesicle is released during exocytosis, suggesting therapies.[1] that it may be possible to regulate the fraction released using pharmaceutical 1.

142 Chapter 3 | Composition of Substances and Solutions 3.2 Determining Empirical and Molecular Formulas By the end of this section, you will be able to: Compute the percent composition of a compound • Determine the empirical formula of a compound • Determine the molecular formula of a compound • In the previous section, we discussed the relationship between the bulk mass of a substance and the number of atoms or molecules it contains (moles). Given the chemical formula of the substance, we were able to determine the amount of the substance (moles) from its mass, and vice versa. But what if the chemical formula of a substance is unknown? In this section, we will explore how to apply these very same principles in order to derive the chemical formulas of unknown substances from experimental mass measurements. Percent Composition The elemental makeup of a compound defines its chemical identity, and chemical formulas are the most succinct way of representing this elemental makeup. When a compound’s formula is unknown, measuring the mass of each of its constituent elements is often the first step in the process of determining the formula experimentally. The results of these measurements permit the calculation of the compound’s percent composition, defined as the percentage by mass of each element in the compound. For example, consider a gaseous compound composed solely of carbon and hydrogen. The percent composition of this compound could be represented as follows: mass H % H = × 100% mass compound mass C % C = × 100% mass compound If analysis of a 10.0-g sample of this gas showed it to contain 2.5 g H and 7.5 g C, the percent composition would be calculated to be 25% H and 75% C: 2.5 g H % H = × 100% = 25% 10.0 g compound 7.5 g C % C = × 100% = 75% 10.0 g compound Example 3.9 Calculation of Percent Composition Analysis of a 12.04-g sample of a liquid compound composed of carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen showed it to contain 7.34 g C, 1.85 g H, and 2.85 g N. What is the percent composition of this compound? Solution To calculate percent composition, we divide the experimentally derived mass of each element by the overall mass of the compound, and then convert to a percentage: 7.34 g C % C = × 100% = 61.0% 12.04 g compound 1.85 g H % H = × 100% = 15.4% compound 12.04 g 2.85 g N % N = × 100% = 23.7% compound 12.04 g https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

Check Your Learning A 24.81-g sample of a gaseous compound containing only carbon, oxygen, and chlorine is determined to contain 3.01 g C, 4.00 g O, and 17.81 g Cl. What is this compound’s percent composition? Answer: 12.1% C, 16.1% O, 71.8% Cl Determining Percent Composition from Formula Mass Percent composition is also useful for evaluating the relative abundance of a given element in different compounds of known formulas. As one example, consider the common nitrogen-containing fertilizers ammonia (NH3), ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3), and urea (CH4N2O). The element nitrogen is the active ingredient for agricultural purposes, so the mass percentage of nitrogen in the compound is a practical and economic concern for consumers choosing among these fertilizers. For these sorts of applications, the percent composition of a compound is easily derived from its formula mass and the atomic masses of its constituent elements. A molecule of NH3 contains one N atom weighing × 1.008 amu) = 3.024 amu. The formula mass of ammonia is 14.01 amu and three H atoms weighing a total of (3 therefore (14.01 amu + 3.024 amu) = 17.03 amu, and its percent composition is: 14.01 amu N % N = × 100% = 82.27% 17.03 amu NH3 3.024 amu N % H = × 100% = 17.76% 17.03 amu NH3 This same approach may be taken considering a pair of molecules, a dozen molecules, or a mole of molecules, etc. The latter amount is most convenient and would simply involve the use of molar masses instead of atomic and formula Example 3.10. masses, as demonstrated As long as we know the chemical formula of the substance in question, we can easily derive percent composition from the formula mass or molar mass. Example 3.10 Determining Percent Composition from a Molecular Formula Aspirin is a compound with the molecular formula C9H8O4. What is its percent composition? Solution To calculate the percent composition, we need to know the masses of C, H, and O in a known mass of C9H8O4. It is convenient to consider 1 mol of C9H8O4 and use its molar mass (180.159 g/mole, determined from the chemical formula) to calculate the percentages of each of its elements: 9 × 12.01 g/mol 108.09 g/mol 9 mol C × molar mass C % C = × 100 = × 100 = × 100 molar mass C9 H18 O4 180.159 g/mol 180.159 g/mol % C = 60.00% C 8 × 1.008 g/mol 8.064 g/mol 8 mol H × molar mass H % H = × 100 = × 100 = × 100 molar mass C9 H18 O4 180.159 g/mol 180.159 g/mol 4.476% H % H = 4 × 16.00 g/mol 64.00 g/mol 4 mol O × molar mass O % O = × 100 = × 100 = × 100 molar mass C9 H18 O4 180.159 g/mol 180.159 g/mol % O = 35.52% Note that these percentages sum to equal 100.00% when appropriately rounded.

144 Chapter 3 | Composition of Substances and Solutions To three significant digits, what is the mass percentage of iron in the compound Fe2O3? Answer: 69.9% Fe Determination of Empirical Formulas As previously mentioned, the most common approach to determining a compound’s chemical formula is to first measure the masses of its constituent elements. However, we must keep in mind that chemical formulas represent the relative numbers, not masses, of atoms in the substance. Therefore, any experimentally derived data involving mass must be used to derive the corresponding numbers of atoms in the compound. To accomplish this, we can use molar masses to convert the mass of each element to a number of moles. We then consider the moles of each element relative to each other, converting these numbers into a whole-number ratio that can be used to derive the empirical formula of the substance. Consider a sample of compound determined to contain 1.71 g C and 0.287 g H. The corresponding numbers of atoms (in moles) are: 1 mol C 1.17 g C × = 0.142 mol C 12.01 g C 1 mol H 0.287 g H × = 0.284 mol H 1.008 g H Thus, we can accurately represent this compound with the formula C0.142H0.248. Of course, per accepted convention, formulas contain whole-number subscripts, which can be achieved by dividing each subscript by the smaller subscript: C H or CH2 0.142 0.248 0.142 0.142 (Recall that subscripts of “1” are not written but rather assumed if no other number is present.) The empirical formula for this compound is thus CH2. This may or not be the compound’s molecular formula as well; however, we would need additional information to make that determination (as discussed later in this section). Consider as another example a sample of compound determined to contain 5.31 g Cl and 8.40 g O. Following the same approach yields a tentative empirical formula of: C10.150 O0.525 = Cl O = ClO3.5 0.150 0.525 0.150 0.150 In this case, dividing by the smallest subscript still leaves us with a decimal subscript in the empirical formula. To convert this into a whole number, we must multiply each of the subscripts by two, retaining the same atom ratio and yielding Cl2O7 as the final empirical formula. In summary, empirical formulas are derived from experimentally measured element masses by: Deriving the number of moles of each element from its mass 1. Dividing each element’s molar amount by the smallest molar amount to yield subscripts for a tentative 2. empirical formula Multiplying all coefficients by an integer, if necessary, to ensure that the smallest whole-number ratio of 3. subscripts is obtained Figure 3.11 outlines this procedure in flow chart fashion for a substance containing elements A and X. https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

Chapter 3 | Composition of Substances and Solutions 145 Figure 3.11 The empirical formula of a compound can be derived from the masses of all elements in the sample. Example 3.11 Determining a Compound’s Empirical Formula from the Masses of Its Elements (Figure 3.12), A sample of the black mineral hematite an oxide of iron found in many iron ores, contains 34.97 g of iron and 15.03 g of oxygen.

Deriving Empirical Formulas from Percent Composition Finally, with regard to deriving empirical formulas, consider instances in which a compound’s percent composition is available rather than the absolute masses of the compound’s constituent elements. In such cases, the percent composition can be used to calculate the masses of elements present in any convenient mass of compound; these masses can then be used to derive the empirical formula in the usual fashion.

Chapter 3 | Composition of Substances and Solutions 147 Figure 3.13 An oxide of carbon is removed from these fermentation tanks through the large copper pipes at the top. (credit: “Dual Freq”/Wikimedia Commons) Solution Since the scale for percentages is 100, it is most convenient to calculate the mass of elements present in a sample weighing 100 g. The calculation is “most convenient” because, per the definition for percent composition, the mass of a given element in grams is numerically equivalent to the element’s mass percentage. This numerical equivalence results from the definition of the “percentage” unit, whose name is derived from the Latin phrase per centum meaning “by the hundred.” Considering this definition, the mass percentages provided may be more conveniently expressed as fractions: 27.29 g C 27.29% C = 100 g compound 72.71 g O 72.71% O = 100 g compound The molar amounts of carbon and hydrogen in a 100-g sample are calculated by dividing each element’s mass by its molar mass: C⎛ ⎞ mol C ⎝ ⎠= 27.29 g 2.272 mol C 12.01 g ⎞ O⎛ mol O ⎠= ⎝ 4.544 mol O 72.71 g 16.00 g Coefficients for the tentative empirical formula are derived by dividing each molar amount by the lesser of the two: 2.272 mol C = 1 2.272 4.544 mol O = 2 2.272

Check Your Learning What is the empirical formula of a compound containing 40.0% C, 6.71% H, and 53.28% O? Answer: CH2O Derivation of Molecular Formulas Recall that empirical formulas are symbols representing the relative numbers of a compound’s elements. Determining the absolute numbers of atoms that compose a single molecule of a covalent compound requires knowledge of both its empirical formula and its molecular mass or molar mass. These quantities may be determined experimentally by various measurement techniques. Molecular mass, for example, is often derived from the mass spectrum of the compound (see discussion of this technique in the previous chapter on atoms and molecules). Molar mass can be measured by a number of experimental methods, many of which will be introduced in later chapters of this text. Molecular formulas are derived by comparing the compound’s molecular or molar mass to its empirical formula mass. As the name suggests, an empirical formula mass is the sum of the average atomic masses of all the atoms represented in an empirical formula. If we know the molecular (or molar) mass of the substance, we can divide this by the empirical formula mass in order to identify the number of empirical formula units per molecule, which we designate as n: ⎛ ⎞ g molecular or molar mass ⎝amu or ⎠ mol = n formula units/molecule ⎛ ⎞ g empirical formula mass ⎝amu or ⎠ mol The molecular formula is then obtained by multiplying each subscript in the empirical formula by n, as shown by the generic empirical formula AxBy: (Ax By)n = Anx Bnx For example, consider a covalent compound whose empirical formula is determined to be CH2O. The empirical formula mass for this compound is approximately 30 amu (the sum of 12 amu for one C atom, 2 amu for two H atoms, and 16 amu for one O atom). If the compound’s molecular mass is determined to be 180 amu, this indicates that molecules of this compound contain six times the number of atoms represented in the empirical formula: 180 amu/molecule = 6 formula units/molecule amu 30 formula unit Molecules of this compound are then represented by molecular formulas whose subscripts are six times greater than those in the empirical formula: (CH2 O)6 = C6 H12 O6 Note that this same approach may be used when the molar mass (g/mol) instead of the molecular mass (amu) is used. In this case, we are merely considering one mole of empirical formula units and molecules, as opposed to single units and molecules. Example 3.13 Determination of the Molecular Formula for Nicotine Nicotine, an alkaloid in the nightshade family of plants that is mainly responsible for the addictive nature of cigarettes, contains 74.02% C, 8.710% H, and 17.27% N.

Chapter 3 | Composition of Substances and Solutions 149 Solution Determining the molecular formula from the provided data will require comparison of the compound’s empirical formula mass to its molar mass. As the first step, use the percent composition to derive the compound’s empirical formula. Assuming a convenient, a 100-g sample of nicotine yields the following molar amounts of its elements: ⎠⎛ ⎞ 1 mol C ⎝ ⎠ ⎛ ⎞ ⎝74.02 g C = 6.163 mol C 12.01 g C ⎞ ⎠⎛ 1 mol H ⎠ ⎝ ⎛ ⎞ = 8.624 mol H ⎝8.710 g H 1.01 g H ⎠⎛ ⎞ 1 mol N ⎝ ⎠= ⎛ ⎞ ⎝17.27 g N 1.233 mol N 14.01 g N Next, we calculate the molar ratios of these elements. The C-to-N and H-to-N molar ratios are adequately close to whole numbers, and so the empirical formula is C5H7N. The empirical formula mass for this compound is therefore 81.13 amu/formula unit, or 81.13 g/ mol formula unit. We calculate the molar mass for nicotine from the given mass and molar amount of compound: 162.3 g 40.57 g nicotine = mol 0.2500 mol nicotine Comparing the molar mass and empirical formula mass indicates that each nicotine molecule contains two formula units: 162.3 g/mol = 2 formula units/molecule g 81.13 formula unit Thus, we can derive the molecular formula for nicotine from the empirical formula by multiplying each subscript by two: (C5 H7 N)6 = C10 H14 N2 Check Your Learning What is the molecular formula of a compound with a percent composition of 49.47% C, 5.201% H, 28.84% N, and 16.48% O, and a molecular mass of 194.2 amu?

However, mixtures—samples of matter containing two or more substances physically combined—are more commonly encountered in nature than are pure substances. Similar to a pure substance, the relative composition of a mixture plays an important role in determining its properties.

Figure 3.14 Sugar is one of many components in the complex mixture known as coffee. The amount of sugar in a given amount of coffee is an important determinant of the beverage’s sweetness. (credit: Jane Whitney) Solutions We have previously defined solutions as homogeneous mixtures, meaning that the composition of the mixture (and therefore its properties) is uniform throughout its entire volume. Solutions occur frequently in nature and have also been implemented in many forms of manmade technology. We will explore a more thorough treatment of solution properties in the chapter on solutions and colloids, but here we will introduce some of the basic properties of solutions. The relative amount of a given solution component is known as its concentration. Often, though not always, a solution contains one component with a concentration that is significantly greater than that of all other components. This component is called the solvent and may be viewed as the medium in which the other components are dispersed, or dissolved. Solutions in which water is the solvent are, of course, very common on our planet. A solution in which water is the solvent is called an aqueous solution. A solute is a component of a solution that is typically present at a much lower concentration than the solvent. Solute concentrations are often described with qualitative terms such as dilute (of relatively low concentration) and concentrated (of relatively high concentration). Concentrations may be quantitatively assessed using a wide variety of measurement units, each convenient for particular applications. Molarity (M) is a useful concentration unit for many applications in chemistry. Molarity is defined as the number of moles of solute in exactly 1 liter (1 L) of the solution: mol solute M = L solution Example 3.14 Calculating Molar Concentrations https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

If we had not retained this guard digit, the final calculation for the mass of NaCl would have been 77.1 g, a difference of 0.3 g. In addition to retaining a guard digit for intermediate calculations, we can also avoid rounding errors by performing Example 3.18). computations in a single step (see This eliminates intermediate steps so that only the final result is rounded.

154 Chapter 3 | Composition of Substances and Solutions Dilution of Solutions Dilution is the process whereby the concentration of a solution is lessened by the addition of solvent. For example, we might say that a glass of iced tea becomes increasingly diluted as the ice melts. The water from the melting ice increases the volume of the solvent (water) and the overall volume of the solution (iced tea), thereby reducing the (Figure 3.16). relative concentrations of the solutes that give the beverage its taste Figure 3.16 Both solutions contain the same mass of copper nitrate. The solution on the right is more dilute because the copper nitrate is dissolved in more solvent. (credit: Mark Ott) Dilution is also a common means of preparing solutions of a desired concentration. By adding solvent to a measured portion of a more concentrated stock solution, we can achieve a particular concentration. For example, commercial pesticides are typically sold as solutions in which the active ingredients are far more concentrated than is appropriate for their application. Before they can be used on crops, the pesticides must be diluted.

Although we derived this equation using molarity as the unit of concentration and liters as the unit of volume, other units of concentration and volume may be used, so long as the units properly cancel per the factor-label method. Reflecting this versatility, the dilution equation is often written in the more general form: C1 V1 = C2 V2 where C and V are concentration and volume, respectively. Link to Learning Use the simulation (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/16Phetsolvents) to explore the relations between solute amount, solution volume, and concentration and to confirm the dilution equation. Example 3.19 Determining the Concentration of a Diluted Solution If 0.850 L of a 5.00-M solution of copper nitrate, Cu(NO3)2, is diluted to a volume of 1.80 L by the addition of water, what is the molarity of the diluted solution? Solution We are given the volume and concentration of a stock solution, V1 and C1, and the volume of the resultant diluted solution, V2. We need to find the concentration of the diluted solution, C2. We thus rearrange the dilution equation in order to isolate C2: C1 V1 = C2 V2 C1 V1 C2 = V2 Since the stock solution is being diluted by more than two-fold (volume is increased from 0.85 L to 1.80 L), we would expect the diluted solution’s concentration to be less than one-half 5 M. We will compare this ballpark estimate to the calculated result to check for any gross errors in computation (for example, such as an improper substitution of the given quantities). Substituting the given values for the terms on the right side of this equation yields: mol 0.850 L × 5.00 L C2 = = 2.36 M 1.80 L This result compares well to our ballpark estimate (it’s a bit less than one-half the stock concentration, 5 M).

Answer: 0.102 M CH3OH Example 3.20 Volume of a Diluted Solution What volume of 0.12 M HBr can be prepared from 11 mL (0.011 L) of 0.45 M HBr? Solution We are given the volume and concentration of a stock solution, V1 and C1, and the concentration of the resultant diluted solution, C2. We need to find the volume of the diluted solution, V2. We thus rearrange the dilution equation in order to isolate V2: C1 V1 = C2 V2 C1 V1 V2 = C2 Since the diluted concentration (0.12 M) is slightly more than one-fourth the original concentration (0.45 M), we would expect the volume of the diluted solution to be roughly four times the original concentration, or around 44 mL. Substituting the given values and solving for the unknown volume yields: (0.45 M)(0.011 L) V2 = (0.12 M) V2 = 0.041 L The volume of the 0.12-M solution is 0.041 L (41 mL).

Solution We are given the concentration of a stock solution, C1, and the volume and concentration of the resultant diluted solution, V2 and C2. We need to find the volume of the stock solution, V1. We thus rearrange the dilution equation in order to isolate V1: C1 V1 = C2 V2 C2 V2 V1 = C1 https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

Chapter 3 | Composition of Substances and Solutions 157 Since the concentration of the diluted solution 0.100 M is roughly one-sixteenth that of the stock solution (1.59 M), we would expect the volume of the stock solution to be about one-sixteenth that of the diluted solution, or around 0.3 liters. Substituting the given values and solving for the unknown volume yields: (0.100 M)(5.00 L) V1 = 1.59 M V1 = 0.314 L Thus, we would need 0.314 L of the 1.59-M solution to prepare the desired solution. This result is consistent with our rough estimate. Check Your Learning What volume of a 0.575-M solution of glucose, C6H12O6, can be prepared from 50.00 mL of a 3.00-M glucose solution? Answer: 0.261 L 3.4 Other Units for Solution Concentrations By the end of this section, you will be able to: Define the concentration units of mass percentage, volume percentage, mass-volume percentage, • parts-per-million (ppm), and parts-per-billion (ppb) Perform computations relating a solution’s concentration and its components’ volumes and/or masses • using these units In the previous section, we introduced molarity, a very useful measurement unit for evaluating the concentration of solutions. However, molarity is only one measure of concentration. In this section, we will introduce some other units of concentration that are commonly used in various applications, either for convenience or by convention. Mass Percentage Earlier in this chapter, we introduced percent composition as a measure of the relative amount of a given element in a compound. Percentages are also commonly used to express the composition of mixtures, including solutions. The mass percentage of a solution component is defined as the ratio of the component’s mass to the solution’s mass, expressed as a percentage: mass of component mass percentage = × 100% mass of solution We are generally most interested in the mass percentages of solutes, but it is also possible to compute the mass percentage of solvent. Mass percentage is also referred to by similar names such as percent mass, percent weight, weight/weight percent, and other variations on this theme. The most common symbol for mass percentage is simply the percent sign, %, although more detailed symbols are often used including %mass, %weight, and (w/w)%. Use of these more detailed symbols can prevent confusion of mass percentages with other types of percentages, such as volume percentages (to be discussed later in this section). Mass percentages are popular concentration units for consumer products. The label of a typical liquid bleach bottle (Figure 3.18) cites the concentration of its active ingredient, sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl), as being 7.4%. A 100.0-g sample of bleach would therefore contain 7.4 g of NaOCl.

Example 3.22 Calculation of Percent by Mass A 5.0-g sample of spinal fluid contains 3.75 mg (0.00375 g) of glucose. What is the percent by mass of glucose in spinal fluid? Solution The spinal fluid sample contains roughly 4 mg of glucose in 5000 mg of fluid, so the mass fraction of glucose should be a bit less than one part in 1000, or about 0.1%. Substituting the given masses into the equation defining mass percentage yields: 1 g 3.75 mg glucose × 1000 mg % glucose = = 0.075% 5.0 g spinal flui The computed mass percentage agrees with our rough estimate (it’s a bit less than 0.1%). Note that while any mass unit may be used to compute a mass percentage (mg, g, kg, oz, and so on), the same unit must be used for both the solute and the solution so that the mass units cancel, yielding a dimensionless ratio. In this case, we converted the units of solute in the numerator from mg to g to match the units in the denominator. We could just as easily have converted the denominator from g to mg instead. As long as identical mass units are used for both solute and solution, the computed mass percentage will be correct.

Chapter 3 | Composition of Substances and Solutions 159 Example 3.23 Calculations using Mass Percentage “Concentrated” hydrochloric acid is an aqueous solution of 37.2% HCl that is commonly used as a laboratory reagent. The density of this solution is 1.19 g/mL. What mass of HCl is contained in 0.500 L of this solution? Solution The HCl concentration is near 40%, so a 100-g portion of this solution would contain about 40 g of HCl. Since the solution density isn’t greatly different from that of water (1 g/mL), a reasonable estimate of the × HCl mass in 500 g (0.5 L) of the solution is about five times greater than that in a 100 g portion, or 5 40 = 200 g. In order to derive the mass of solute in a solution from its mass percentage, we need to know the corresponding mass of the solution. Using the solution density given, we can convert the solution’s volume to mass, and then use the given mass percentage to calculate the solute mass. This mathematical approach is outlined in this flowchart: For proper unit cancellation, the 0.500-L volume is converted into 500 mL, and the mass percentage is expressed as a ratio, 37.2 g HCl/g solution: ⎞ ⎛ ⎛ ⎞ 1.19 g solution 37.2 g HCl ⎠= ⎝ ⎝ ⎠ 221 g HCl 500 mL solution mL solution 100 g solution This mass of HCl is consistent with our rough estimate of approximately 200 g.

Answer: 282 mL Volume Percentage Liquid volumes over a wide range of magnitudes are conveniently measured using common and relatively inexpensive laboratory equipment. The concentration of a solution formed by dissolving a liquid solute in a liquid solvent is therefore often expressed as a volume percentage, %vol or (v/v)%: volume solute volume percentage = × 100% volume solution Example 3.24 Calculations using Volume Percentage Rubbing alcohol (isopropanol) is usually sold as a 70%vol aqueous solution.

Ethanol has a molar mass of 46.06 g/mol and a density 0.789 g/mL. How many moles of ethanol are present in a 750-mL bottle of wine? Answer: 1.5 mol ethanol Mass-Volume Percentage “Mixed” percentage units, derived from the mass of solute and the volume of solution, are popular for certain biochemical and medical applications. A mass-volume percent is a ratio of a solute’s mass to the solution’s volume expressed as a percentage. The specific units used for solute mass and solution volume may vary, depending on the solution. For example, physiological saline solution, used to prepare intravenous fluids, has a concentration of 0.9% mass/volume (m/v), indicating that the composition is 0.9 g of solute per 100 mL of solution. The concentration of glucose in blood (commonly referred to as “blood sugar”) is also typically expressed in terms of a mass-volume ratio. Though not expressed explicitly as a percentage, its concentration is usually given in milligrams of glucose per (Figure 3.19). deciliter (100 mL) of blood Figure 3.19 “Mixed” mass-volume units are commonly encountered in medical settings. (a) The NaCl concentration of physiological saline is 0.9% (m/v). (b) This device measures glucose levels in a sample of blood.

The mass-based definitions of ppm and ppb are given here: mass solute 106 ppm = × ppm mass solution mass solute 109 ppb = × ppb mass solution Both ppm and ppb are convenient units for reporting the concentrations of pollutants and other trace contaminants in water. Concentrations of these contaminants are typically very low in treated and natural waters, and their levels cannot exceed relatively low concentration thresholds without causing adverse effects on health and wildlife. For example, the EPA has identified the maximum safe level of fluoride ion in tap water to be 4 ppm. Inline water filters (Figure are designed to reduce the concentration of fluoride and several other trace-level contaminants in tap water 3.20).

What is this concentration in ppm? At this concentration, what mass of lead (μg) would be contained in a typical glass of water (300 mL)? Solution The definitions of the ppm and ppb units may be used to convert the given concentration from ppb to ppm. 103 Comparing these two unit definitions shows that ppm is 1000 times greater than ppb (1 ppm = ppb). Thus:

However, only the volume of solution (300 mL) is given, so we must use the density to derive the corresponding mass. We can assume the density of tap water to be roughly the same as that of pure water (~1.00 g/mL), since the concentrations of any dissolved substances should not be very large.

The formula mass of a covalent compound is also called the molecular mass. A convenient amount unit for expressing very large numbers of atoms or molecules is the mole. Experimental 1023, × measurements have determined the number of entities composing 1 mole of substance to be 6.022 a quantity called Avogadro’s number. The mass in grams of 1 mole of substance is its molar mass. Due to the use of the same reference substance in defining the atomic mass unit and the mole, the formula mass (amu) and molar mass (g/mol) for any substance are numerically equivalent (for example, one H2O molecule weighs approximately18 amu and 1 mole of H2O molecules weighs approximately 18 g). 3.2 Determining Empirical and Molecular Formulas The chemical identity of a substance is defined by the types and relative numbers of atoms composing its fundamental entities (molecules in the case of covalent compounds, ions in the case of ionic compounds). A compound’s percent composition provides the mass percentage of each element in the compound, and it is often experimentally determined and used to derive the compound’s empirical formula. The empirical formula mass of a covalent compound may be compared to the compound’s molecular or molar mass to derive a molecular formula. 3.3 Molarity Solutions are homogeneous mixtures. Many solutions contain one component, called the solvent, in which other components, called solutes, are dissolved. An aqueous solution is one for which the solvent is water. The concentration of a solution is a measure of the relative amount of solute in a given amount of solution. Concentrations may be measured using various units, with one very useful unit being molarity, defined as the number of moles of solute per liter of solution. The solute concentration of a solution may be decreased by adding solvent, a process referred to as dilution. The dilution equation is a simple relation between concentrations and volumes of a solution before and after dilution. 3.4 Other Units for Solution Concentrations In addition to molarity, a number of other solution concentration units are used in various applications. Percentage concentrations based on the solution components’ masses, volumes, or both are useful for expressing relatively high concentrations, whereas lower concentrations are conveniently expressed using ppm or ppb units. These units are popular in environmental, medical, and other fields where mole-based units such as molarity are not as commonly used. Exercises 3.1 Formula Mass and the Mole Concept 1.

Chapter 4 | Stoichiometry of Chemical Reactions 175 Chapter 4 Stoichiometry of Chemical Reactions Figure 4.1 Many modern rocket fuels are solid mixtures of substances combined in carefully measured amounts and ignited to yield a thrust-generating chemical reaction. (credit: modification of work by NASA) Chapter Outline 4.1 Writing and Balancing Chemical Equations 4.2 Classifying Chemical Reactions 4.3 Reaction Stoichiometry 4.4 Reaction Yields 4.5 Quantitative Chemical Analysis Introduction Solid-fuel rockets are a central feature in the world’s space exploration programs, including the new Space Launch System being developed by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to replace the retired Space (Figure 4.1). Shuttle fleet The engines of these rockets rely on carefully prepared solid mixtures of chemicals combined in precisely measured amounts. Igniting the mixture initiates a vigorous chemical reaction that rapidly generates large amounts of gaseous products. These gases are ejected from the rocket engine through its nozzle, providing the thrust needed to propel heavy payloads into space. Both the nature of this chemical reaction and the relationships between the amounts of the substances being consumed and produced by the reaction are critically important considerations that determine the success of the technology. This chapter will describe how to symbolize chemical reactions using chemical equations, how to classify some common chemical reactions by identifying patterns of reactivity, and how to determine the quantitative relations between the amounts of substances involved in chemical reactions—that is, the reaction stoichiometry.

176 Chapter 4 | Stoichiometry of Chemical Reactions 4.1 Writing and Balancing Chemical Equations By the end of this section, you will be able to: Derive chemical equations from narrative descriptions of chemical reactions. • Write and balance chemical equations in molecular, total ionic, and net ionic formats. • The preceding chapter introduced the use of element symbols to represent individual atoms. When atoms gain or lose electrons to yield ions, or combine with other atoms to form molecules, their symbols are modified or combined to generate chemical formulas that appropriately represent these species. Extending this symbolism to represent both the identities and the relative quantities of substances undergoing a chemical (or physical) change involves writing and balancing a chemical equation. Consider as an example the reaction between one methane molecule (CH4) and two diatomic oxygen molecules (O2) to produce one carbon dioxide molecule (CO2) and two water molecules (H2O). The Figure 4.2, chemical equation representing this process is provided in the upper half of with space-filling molecular models shown in the lower half of the figure. Figure 4.2 The reaction between methane and oxygen to yield carbon dioxide in water (shown at bottom) may be represented by a chemical equation using formulas (top). This example illustrates the fundamental aspects of any chemical equation: The substances undergoing reaction are called reactants, and their formulas are placed on the left side of the 1. equation. The substances generated by the reaction are called products, and their formulas are placed on the right sight 2. of the equation. (⟶) separates the reactant Plus signs (+) separate individual reactant and product formulas, and an arrow 3. and product (left and right) sides of the equation. The relative numbers of reactant and product species are represented by coefficients (numbers placed 4. immediately to the left of each formula). A coefficient of 1 is typically omitted. It is common practice to use the smallest possible whole-number coefficients in a chemical equation, as is done in this example. Realize, however, that these coefficients represent the relative numbers of reactants and products, and, therefore, they may be correctly interpreted as ratios. Methane and oxygen react to yield carbon dioxide and water in a 1:2:1:2 ratio. This ratio is satisfied if the numbers of these molecules are, respectively, 1-2-1-2, or 2-4-2-4, or (Figure 4.3). 3-6-3-6, and so on Likewise, these coefficients may be interpreted with regard to any amount (number) unit, and so this equation may be correctly read in many ways, including: https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

Chapter 4 | Stoichiometry of Chemical Reactions 177 One methane molecule and two oxygen molecules react to yield one carbon dioxide molecule and two water • molecules. One dozen methane molecules and two dozen oxygen molecules react to yield one dozen carbon dioxide • molecules and two dozen water molecules. One mole of methane molecules and 2 moles of oxygen molecules react to yield 1 mole of carbon dioxide • molecules and 2 moles of water molecules. Figure 4.3 Regardless of the absolute number of molecules involved, the ratios between numbers of molecules are the same as that given in the chemical equation. Balancing Equations The chemical equation described in section 4.1 is balanced, meaning that equal numbers of atoms for each element involved in the reaction are represented on the reactant and product sides. This is a requirement the equation must satisfy to be consistent with the law of conservation of matter. It may be confirmed by simply summing the numbers of atoms on either side of the arrow and comparing these sums to ensure they are equal. Note that the number of atoms for a given element is calculated by multiplying the coefficient of any formula containing that element by the element’s subscript in the formula. If an element appears in more than one formula on a given side of the equation, the number of atoms represented in each must be computed and then added together. For example, both product species in the example reaction, CO2 and H2O, contain the element oxygen, and so the number of oxygen atoms on the product side of the equation is ⎛ ⎞ ⎛ ⎞ 2 O atoms 1 O atom ⎝1 ⎠+ ⎝2 ⎠= CO2 molecule × H2 O molecule × 4 O atoms CO2 molecule H2 O molecule The equation for the reaction between methane and oxygen to yield carbon dioxide and water is confirmed to be balanced per this approach, as shown here: CH4 + 2O2 ⟶CO2 + 2H2 O Element Reactants Products Balanced? × × C 1 1 = 1 1 1 = 1 1 = 1, yes × × 1 = 4 2 2 = 4 4 = 4, yes H 4 × × × O 2 2 = 4 (1 2) + (2 1) = 4 4 = 4, yes

178 Chapter 4 | Stoichiometry of Chemical Reactions A balanced chemical equation often may be derived from a qualitative description of some chemical reaction by a fairly simple approach known as balancing by inspection. Consider as an example the decomposition of water to yield molecular hydrogen and oxygen. This process is represented qualitatively by an unbalanced chemical equation: H2 O ⟶H2 + O2 (unbalanced) Comparing the number of H and O atoms on either side of this equation confirms its imbalance: Element Reactants Products Balanced? × × H 1 2 = 2 1 2 = 2 2 = 2, yes × × O 1 1 = 1 1 2 = 2 1 ≠ 2, no The numbers of H atoms on the reactant and product sides of the equation are equal, but the numbers of O atoms are not. To achieve balance, the coefficients of the equation may be changed as needed. Keep in mind, of course, that the formula subscripts define, in part, the identity of the substance, and so these cannot be changed without altering the qualitative meaning of the equation. For example, changing the reactant formula from H2O to H2O2 would yield balance in the number of atoms, but doing so also changes the reactant’s identity (it’s now hydrogen peroxide and not water). The O atom balance may be achieved by changing the coefficient for H2O to 2. 2H2 O ⟶H2 + O2 (unbalanced) Element Reactants Products Balanced? × × H 2 2 = 4 1 2 = 2 4 ≠ 2, no × × O 2 1 = 2 1 2 = 2 2 = 2, yes The H atom balance was upset by this change, but it is easily reestablished by changing the coefficient for the H2 product to 2. ⟶2H2 2H2 O + O2 (balanced) Element Reactants Products Balanced? × × H 2 2 = 4 2 2 = 2 4 = 4, yes × × O 2 1 = 2 1 2 = 2 2 = 2, yes These coefficients yield equal numbers of both H and O atoms on the reactant and product sides, and the balanced equation is, therefore: 2H2 O ⟶2H2 + O2 Example 4.1 Balancing Chemical Equations https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

Chapter 4 | Stoichiometry of Chemical Reactions 179 Write a balanced equation for the reaction of molecular nitrogen (N2) and oxygen (O2) to form dinitrogen pentoxide. Solution First, write the unbalanced equation. N2 + O2 ⟶N2 O5 (unbalanced) Next, count the number of each type of atom present in the unbalanced equation. Element Reactants Products Balanced? × × 2 = 2 1 2 = 2 2 = 2, yes N 1 × × O 1 2 = 2 1 5 = 5 2 ≠ 5, no Though nitrogen is balanced, changes in coefficients are needed to balance the number of oxygen atoms. To balance the number of oxygen atoms, a reasonable first attempt would be to change the coefficients for the O2 and N2O5 to integers that will yield 10 O atoms (the least common multiple for the O atom subscripts in these two formulas). 5O2 ⟶2N2 N2 + O5 (unbalanced) Element Reactants Products Balanced? × × N 1 2 = 2 2 2 = 4 2 ≠ 4, no × × O 5 2 = 10 2 5 = 10 10 = 10, yes The N atom balance has been upset by this change; it is restored by changing the coefficient for the reactant N2 to 2. 2N2 + 5O2 ⟶2N2 O5 Element Reactants Products Balanced? × × N 2 2 = 4 2 2 = 4 4 = 4, yes × × O 5 2 = 10 2 5 = 10 10 = 10, yes The numbers of N and O atoms on either side of the equation are now equal, and so the equation is balanced.

180 Chapter 4 | Stoichiometry of Chemical Reactions It is sometimes convenient to use fractions instead of integers as intermediate coefficients in the process of balancing a chemical equation. When balance is achieved, all the equation’s coefficients may then be multiplied by a whole number to convert the fractional coefficients to integers without upsetting the atom balance. For example, consider the reaction of ethane (C2H6) with oxygen to yield H2O and CO2, represented by the unbalanced equation: C2 H6 + O2 ⟶H2 O + CO2 (unbalanced) Following the usual inspection approach, one might first balance C and H atoms by changing the coefficients for the two product species, as shown: C2 H6 + O2 ⟶3H2 O + 2CO2 (unbalanced) This results in seven O atoms on the product side of the equation, an odd number—no integer coefficient can be used 7 2, with the O2 reactant to yield an odd number, so a fractional coefficient, is used instead to yield a provisional balanced equation: 7 C2 H6 + O2 ⟶3H2 O + 2CO2 2 A conventional balanced equation with integer-only coefficients is derived by multiplying each coefficient by 2: 2C2 H6 + 7O2 ⟶6H2 O + 4CO2 Finally with regard to balanced equations, recall that convention dictates use of the smallest whole-number coefficients. Although the equation for the reaction between molecular nitrogen and molecular hydrogen to produce ammonia is, indeed, balanced, 3N2 + 9H2 ⟶6NH3 the coefficients are not the smallest possible integers representing the relative numbers of reactant and product molecules. Dividing each coefficient by the greatest common factor, 3, gives the preferred equation: N2 + 3H2 ⟶2NH3 Link to Learning Use this interactive tutorial (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/16BalanceEq) for additional practice balancing equations. Additional Information in Chemical Equations The physical states of reactants and products in chemical equations very often are indicated with a parenthetical abbreviation following the formulas. Common abbreviations include s for solids, l for liquids, g for gases, and aq for substances dissolved in water (aqueous solutions, as introduced in the preceding chapter). These notations are illustrated in the example equation here: 2Na(s) + 2H2 O(l) ⟶2NaOH(aq) + H2(g) This equation represents the reaction that takes place when sodium metal is placed in water. The solid sodium reacts with liquid water to produce molecular hydrogen gas and the ionic compound sodium hydroxide (a solid in pure form, but readily dissolved in water). https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

Chapter 4 | Stoichiometry of Chemical Reactions 181 Special conditions necessary for a reaction are sometimes designated by writing a word or symbol above or below the equation’s arrow. For example, a reaction carried out by heating may be indicated by the uppercase Greek letter delta (Δ) over the arrow. Δ CaCO3(s) ⟶ CaO(s) + CO2(g) Other examples of these special conditions will be encountered in more depth in later chapters. Equations for Ionic Reactions Given the abundance of water on earth, it stands to reason that a great many chemical reactions take place in aqueous media. When ions are involved in these reactions, the chemical equations may be written with various levels of detail appropriate to their intended use. To illustrate this, consider a reaction between ionic compounds taking place in an aqueous solution. When aqueous solutions of CaCl2 and AgNO3 are mixed, a reaction takes place producing aqueous Ca(NO3)2 and solid AgCl: CaCl2(aq) + 2AgNO3(aq) ⟶Ca(NO3)2(aq) + 2AgCl(s) This balanced equation, derived in the usual fashion, is called a molecular equation because it doesn’t explicitly represent the ionic species that are present in solution. When ionic compounds dissolve in water, they may dissociate into their constituent ions, which are subsequently dispersed homogenously throughout the resulting solution (a thorough discussion of this important process is provided in the chapter on solutions). Ionic compounds dissolved in water are, therefore, more realistically represented as dissociated ions, in this case: ⟶Ca2+(aq) 2Cl−(aq) + CaCl2(aq) ⟶2Ag+(aq) −(aq) 2AgNO3(aq) + 2NO3 ⟶Ca2+(aq) −(aq) Ca(NO3)2(aq) + 2NO3 Unlike these three ionic compounds, AgCl does not dissolve in water to a significant extent, as signified by its physical state notation, s. Explicitly representing all dissolved ions results in a complete ionic equation. In this particular case, the formulas for the dissolved ionic compounds are replaced by formulas for their dissociated ions: Ca2+(aq) ⟶Ca2+(aq) −(aq) 2Cl−(aq) 2Ag+(aq) −(aq) + 2NO3 + 2AgCl(s) + + + 2NO3 Examining this equation shows that two chemical species are present in identical form on both sides of the arrow, −(aq). Ca2+(aq) NO3 These spectator ions—ions whose presence is required to maintain charge neutrality—are and neither chemically nor physically changed by the process, and so they may be eliminated from the equation to yield a more succinct representation called a net ionic equation: Ca2+(aq) 2Ag+(aq) ⟶Ca2+(aq) 2Cl−(aq) −(aq) −(aq) + + + 2NO3 + 2NO3 + 2AgCl(s) 2Cl−(aq) 2Ag+(aq) + ⟶2AgCl(s) Following the convention of using the smallest possible integers as coefficients, this equation is then written: Cl−(aq) Ag+(aq) + ⟶AgCl(s) This net ionic equation indicates that solid silver chloride may be produced from dissolved chloride and silver(I) ions, regardless of the source of these ions. These molecular and complete ionic equations provide additional information, Cl−and Ag+. namely, the ionic compounds used as sources of Example 4.2

Solution Begin by identifying formulas for the reactants and products and arranging them properly in chemical equation form: CO2(aq) NaOH(aq) ⟶Na2 CO3(aq) + H2 O(l) (unbalanced) + Balance is achieved easily in this case by changing the coefficient for NaOH to 2, resulting in the molecular equation for this reaction: CO2(aq) 2NaOH(aq) ⟶Na2 CO3(aq) + H2 O(l) + The two dissolved ionic compounds, NaOH and Na2CO3, can be represented as dissociated ions to yield the complete ionic equation: 2Na+(aq) 2OH−(aq) ⟶2Na+(aq) 2−(aq) CO2(aq) + + + CO3 + H2 O(l) Na+(aq), Finally, identify the spectator ion(s), in this case and remove it from each side of the equation to generate the net ionic equation: 2Na+(aq) 2OH−(aq) ⟶2Na+(aq) 2−(aq) CO2(aq) + + + CO3 + H2 O(l) 2OH−(aq) 2−(aq) CO2(aq) + ⟶CO3 + H2 O(l) Check Your Learning Diatomic chlorine and sodium hydroxide (lye) are commodity chemicals produced in large quantities, along with diatomic hydrogen, via the electrolysis of brine, according to the following unbalanced equation: electricity ⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯ → NaCl(aq) + H2 O(l) NaOH(aq) + H2(g) + Cl2(g) Write balanced molecular, complete ionic, and net ionic equations for this process. 2NaCl(aq) + 2H2 O(l) ⟶2NaOH(aq) + H2(g) + Cl2(g) (molecular) Answer: ⟶2Na+(aq) 2OH−(aq) 2Na+(aq) 2Cl−(aq) + + H2(g) + Cl2(g) (complete ionic) + + 2H2 O(l) ⟶2OH−(aq) 2Cl−(aq) + H2(g) + Cl2(g) (net ionic) + 2H2 O(l) 4.2 Classifying Chemical Reactions By the end of this section, you will be able to: Define three common types of chemical reactions (precipitation, acid-base, and oxidation-reduction) • Classify chemical reactions as one of these three types given appropriate descriptions or chemical • equations Identify common acids and bases • Predict the solubility of common inorganic compounds by using solubility rules • Compute the oxidation states for elements in compounds • https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

Chapter 4 | Stoichiometry of Chemical Reactions 183 Humans interact with one another in various and complex ways, and we classify these interactions according to common patterns of behavior. When two humans exchange information, we say they are communicating. When they exchange blows with their fists or feet, we say they are fighting. Faced with a wide range of varied interactions between chemical substances, scientists have likewise found it convenient (or even necessary) to classify chemical interactions by identifying common patterns of reactivity. This module will provide an introduction to three of the most prevalent types of chemical reactions: precipitation, acid-base, and oxidation-reduction. Precipitation Reactions and Solubility Rules A precipitation reaction is one in which dissolved substances react to form one (or more) solid products. Many reactions of this type involve the exchange of ions between ionic compounds in aqueous solution and are sometimes referred to as double displacement, double replacement, or metathesis reactions. These reactions are common in nature and are responsible for the formation of coral reefs in ocean waters and kidney stones in animals. They are used widely in industry for production of a number of commodity and specialty chemicals. Precipitation reactions also play a central role in many chemical analysis techniques, including spot tests used to identify metal ions and gravimetric methods for determining the composition of matter (see the last module of this chapter). The extent to which a substance may be dissolved in water, or any solvent, is quantitatively expressed as its solubility, defined as the maximum concentration of a substance that can be achieved under specified conditions. Substances with relatively large solubilities are said to be soluble. A substance will precipitate when solution conditions are such that its concentration exceeds its solubility. Substances with relatively low solubilities are said to be insoluble, and these are the substances that readily precipitate from solution. More information on these important concepts is provided in the text chapter on solutions. For purposes of predicting the identities of solids formed by precipitation (Table reactions, one may simply refer to patterns of solubility that have been observed for many ionic compounds 4.1).

The net ionic equation representing this reaction is: Pb2+(aq) 2I−(aq) + ⟶PbI2(s) (Figure Lead iodide is a bright yellow solid that was formerly used as an artist’s pigment known as iodine yellow 4.4). The properties of pure PbI2 crystals make them useful for fabrication of X-ray and gamma ray detectors. Pb2+ I−are Figure 4.4 A precipitate of PbI2 forms when solutions containing and mixed. (credit: Der Kreole/ Wikimedia Commons) Table 4.2 The solubility guidelines in may be used to predict whether a precipitation reaction will occur when solutions of soluble ionic compounds are mixed together. One merely needs to identify all the ions present in the solution and then consider if possible cation/anion pairing could result in an insoluble compound. For example, −, Na+, F− Ag+, NO3 and mixing solutions of silver nitrate and sodium fluoride will yield a solution containing ions. Aside from the two ionic compounds originally present in the solutions, AgNO3 and NaF, two additional ionic compounds may be derived from this collection of ions: NaNO3 and AgF. The solubility guidelines indicate all nitrate salts are soluble but that AgF is one of the exceptions to the general solubility of fluoride salts. A precipitation reaction, therefore, is predicted to occur, as described by the following equations: ⟶AgF(s) + NaNO3(aq) (molecular) NaF(aq) + AgNO3(aq) Ag+(aq) F−(aq) + ⟶AgF(s) (net ionic) Example 4.3 Predicting Precipitation Reactions https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

Answer: sodium sulfate, BaSO4 Acid-Base Reactions H+, An acid-base reaction is one in which a hydrogen ion, is transferred from one chemical species to another. Such reactions are of central importance to numerous natural and technological processes, ranging from the chemical transformations that take place within cells and the lakes and oceans, to the industrial-scale production of fertilizers, pharmaceuticals, and other substances essential to society. The subject of acid-base chemistry, therefore, is worthy of thorough discussion, and a full chapter is devoted to this topic later in the text. For purposes of this brief introduction, we will consider only the more common types of acid-base reactions that take place in aqueous solutions. In this context, an acid is a substance that will dissolve in water to yield hydronium ions, H3O+. As an example, consider the equation shown here: ⟶Cl−(aq) O+(aq) HCl(aq) + H2 O(aq) + H3 H3O+ The process represented by this equation confirms that hydrogen chloride is an acid. When dissolved in water, H+ ions are produced by a chemical reaction in which ions are transferred from HCl molecules to H2O molecules (Figure 4.5).

186 Chapter 4 | Stoichiometry of Chemical Reactions Figure 4.5 When hydrogen chloride gas dissolves in water, (a) it reacts as an acid, transferring protons to water molecules to yield (b) hydronium ions (and solvated chloride ions). The nature of HCl is such that its reaction with water as just described is essentially 100% efficient: Virtually every HCl molecule that dissolves in water will undergo this reaction. Acids that completely react in this fashion are called (Table strong acids, and HCl is one among just a handful of common acid compounds that are classified as strong 4.2). A far greater number of compounds behave as weak acids and only partially react with water, leaving a large majority of dissolved molecules in their original form and generating a relatively small amount of hydronium ions. Weak acids are commonly encountered in nature, being the substances partly responsible for the tangy taste of citrus fruits, the stinging sensation of insect bites, and the unpleasant smells associated with body odor. A familiar example of a weak acid is acetic acid, the main ingredient in food vinegars: O+(aq) −(aq) CH3 CO2 H(aq) O(l) ⇌CH3 CO2 + H3 + H2 When dissolved in water under typical conditions, only about 1% of acetic acid molecules are present in the ionized −(Figure CH3 CO2 4.6). form, (The use of a double-arrow in the equation above denotes the partial reaction aspect of this process, a concept addressed fully in the chapters on chemical equilibrium.) https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

A base is a substance that will dissolve in water to yield hydroxide ions, The most common bases are ionic compounds composed of alkali or alkaline earth metal cations (groups 1 and 2) combined with the hydroxide ion—for example, NaOH and Ca(OH)2. When these compounds dissolve in water, hydroxide ions are released directly into (K+ the solution. For example, KOH and Ba(OH)2 dissolve in water and dissociate completely to produce cations and Ba2+, OH−. respectively) and hydroxide ions, These bases, along with other hydroxides that completely dissociate in water, are considered strong bases. Consider as an example the dissolution of lye (sodium hydroxide) in water: ⟶Na+(aq) OH−(aq) NaOH(s) +

188 Chapter 4 | Stoichiometry of Chemical Reactions Na+ This equation confirms that sodium hydroxide is a base. When dissolved in water, NaOH dissociates to yield and OH−ions. This is also true for any other ionic compound containing hydroxide ions. Since the dissociation process is essentially complete when ionic compounds dissolve in water under typical conditions, NaOH and other ionic hydroxides are all classified as strong bases. Unlike ionic hydroxides, some compounds produce hydroxide ions when dissolved by chemically reacting with water molecules. In all cases, these compounds react only partially and so are classified as weak bases. These types of compounds are also abundant in nature and important commodities in various technologies. For example, global production of the weak base ammonia is typically well over 100 metric tons annually, being widely used as an agricultural fertilizer, a raw material for chemical synthesis of other compounds, and an active ingredient in household (Figure 4.7). cleaners When dissolved in water, ammonia reacts partially to yield hydroxide ions, as shown here: OH−(aq) +(aq) NH3(aq) + H2 O(l) + ⇌NH4 H+ This is, by definition, an acid-base reaction, in this case involving the transfer of ions from water molecules to + NH4 ammonia molecules. Under typical conditions, only about 1% of the dissolved ammonia is present as ions. Figure 4.7 Ammonia is a weak base used in a variety of applications. (a) Pure ammonia is commonly applied as an agricultural fertilizer. (b) Dilute solutions of ammonia are effective household cleansers. (credit a: modification of work by National Resources Conservation Service; credit b: modification of work by pat00139) The chemical reactions described in which acids and bases dissolved in water produce hydronium and hydroxide ions, respectively, are, by definition, acid-base reactions. In these reactions, water serves as both a solvent and a reactant. A neutralization reaction is a specific type of acid-base reaction in which the reactants are an acid and a base, the products are often a salt and water, and neither reactant is the water itself: acid + base ⟶salt + water To illustrate a neutralization reaction, consider what happens when a typical antacid such as milk of magnesia (an aqueous suspension of solid Mg(OH)2) is ingested to ease symptoms associated with excess stomach acid (HCl): Mg(OH)2(s) + 2HCl(aq) ⟶MgCl2(aq) + 2H2 O(l). Note that in addition to water, this reaction produces a salt, magnesium chloride.

Oxidation-Reduction Reactions Earth’s atmosphere contains about 20% molecular oxygen, O2, a chemically reactive gas that plays an essential role in the metabolism of aerobic organisms and in many environmental processes that shape the world. The term oxidation was originally used to describe chemical reactions involving O2, but its meaning has evolved to refer to a broad and important reaction class known as oxidation-reduction (redox) reactions. A few examples of such reactions will be used to develop a clear picture of this classification. Some redox reactions involve the transfer of electrons between reactant species to yield ionic products, such as the reaction between sodium and chlorine to yield sodium chloride: 2Na(s) + Cl2(g) ⟶2NaCl(s) It is helpful to view the process with regard to each individual reactant, that is, to represent the fate of each reactant in the form of an equation called a half-reaction: ⟶2Na+(s) 2e− 2Na(s) + 2e−⟶2Cl−(s) Cl2(g) + These equations show that Na atoms lose electrons while Cl atoms (in the Cl2 molecule) gain electrons, the “s” subscripts for the resulting ions signifying they are present in the form of a solid ionic compound. For redox reactions of this sort, the loss and gain of electrons define the complementary processes that occur: 

--- Page 198 ---
190 Chapter 4 | Stoichiometry of Chemical Reactions oxidation = loss of electrons reduction = gain of electrons In this reaction, then, sodium is oxidized and chlorine undergoes reduction. Viewed from a more active perspective, sodium functions as a reducing agent (reductant), since it provides electrons to (or reduces) chlorine. Likewise, chlorine functions as an oxidizing agent (oxidant), as it effectively removes electrons from (oxidizes) sodium. reducing agent = species that is oxidized oxidizing agent = species that is reduced Some redox processes, however, do not involve the transfer of electrons. Consider, for example, a reaction similar to the one yielding NaCl: H2(g) + Cl2(g) ⟶2HCl(g) The product of this reaction is a covalent compound, so transfer of electrons in the explicit sense is not involved. To clarify the similarity of this reaction to the previous one and permit an unambiguous definition of redox reactions, a property called oxidation number has been defined. The oxidation number (or oxidation state) of an element in a compound is the charge its atoms would possess if the compound was ionic. The following guidelines are used to assign oxidation numbers to each element in a molecule or ion. The oxidation number of an atom in an elemental substance is zero. 1. The oxidation number of a monatomic ion is equal to the ion’s charge. 2. Oxidation numbers for common nonmetals are usually assigned as follows: 3. Hydrogen: +1 when combined with nonmetals, −1 when combined with metals • −1 2−), O2 very rarely (so- Oxygen: −2 in most compounds, sometimes −1 (so-called peroxides, • 2 −), O2 called superoxides, positive values when combined with F (values vary) Halogens: −1 for F always, −1 for other halogens except when combined with oxygen or other • halogens (positive oxidation numbers in these cases, varying values) The sum of oxidation numbers for all atoms in a molecule or polyatomic ion equals the charge on the molecule 4. or ion. Note: The proper convention for reporting charge is to write the number first, followed by the sign (e.g., 2+), while oxidation number is written with the reversed sequence, sign followed by number (e.g., +2). This convention aims to emphasize the distinction between these two related properties. Example 4.5 Assigning Oxidation Numbers Follow the guidelines in this section of the text to assign oxidation numbers to all the elements in the following species: (a) H2S 2− SO3 (b) (c) Na2SO4 Solution (a) According to guideline 1, the oxidation number for H is +1. https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at 

--- Page 199 ---
Chapter 4 | Stoichiometry of Chemical Reactions 191 Using this oxidation number and the compound’s formula, guideline 4 may then be used to calculate the oxidation number for sulfur: charge on H2 S = 0 = (2 × +1) + (1 × x) x = 0 −(2 × +1) = −2 (b) Guideline 3 suggests the oxidation number for oxygen is −2. Using this oxidation number and the ion’s formula, guideline 4 may then be used to calculate the oxidation number for sulfur: 2−= charge on SO3 −2 = (3 × −1) + (1 × x) x = −2 −(3 × −2) = +4 (c) For ionic compounds, it’s convenient to assign oxidation numbers for the cation and anion separately. According to guideline 2, the oxidation number for sodium is +1. Assuming the usual oxidation number for oxygen (−2 per guideline 3), the oxidation number for sulfur is calculated as directed by guideline 4: 2−= charge on SO4 −2 = (4 × −2) + (1 × x) x = −2 −(4 × −2) = +6 Check Your Learning Assign oxidation states to the elements whose atoms are underlined in each of the following compounds or ions: (a) KNO3 (b) AlH3 + N_H4 (c) − H2 P_O4 (d) Answer: (a) N, +5; (b) Al, +3; (c) N, −3; (d) P, +5 Using the oxidation number concept, an all-inclusive definition of redox reaction has been established. Oxidation- reduction (redox) reactions are those in which one or more elements involved undergo a change in oxidation number. (While the vast majority of redox reactions involve changes in oxidation number for two or more elements, Example 4.6.) a few interesting exceptions to this rule do exist Definitions for the complementary processes of this reaction class are correspondingly revised as shown here: oxidation = increase in oxidation number reduction = decrease in oxidation number Returning to the reactions used to introduce this topic, they may now both be identified as redox processes. In the reaction between sodium and chlorine to yield sodium chloride, sodium is oxidized (its oxidation number increases from 0 in Na to +1 in NaCl) and chlorine is reduced (its oxidation number decreases from 0 in Cl2 to −1 in NaCl). In the reaction between molecular hydrogen and chlorine, hydrogen is oxidized (its oxidation number increases from 0 in H2 to +1 in HCl) and chlorine is reduced (its oxidation number decreases from 0 in Cl2 to −1 in HCl). Several subclasses of redox reactions are recognized, including combustion reactions in which the reductant (also called a fuel) and oxidant (often, but not necessarily, molecular oxygen) react vigorously and produce significant Figure amounts of heat, and often light, in the form of a flame. Solid rocket-fuel reactions such as the one depicted in

A typical propellant reaction in which solid aluminum is oxidized by ammonium perchlorate is represented by this equation: 10Al(s) + 6NH4 ClO4(s) ⟶4Al2 O3(s) + 2AlCl3(s) + 12H2 O(g) + 3N2(g) Link to Learning Watch a brief video (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/16hybridrocket) showing the test firing of a small-scale, prototype, hybrid rocket engine planned for use in the new Space Launch System being developed by NASA. The first engines firing at 3 s (green flame) use a liquid fuel/oxidant mixture, and the second, more powerful engines firing at 4 s (yellow flame) use a solid mixture. Single-displacement (replacement) reactions are redox reactions in which an ion in solution is displaced (or replaced) via the oxidation of a metallic element. One common example of this type of reaction is the acid oxidation of certain metals: Zn(s) + 2HCl(aq) ⟶ZnCl2(aq) + H2(g) Metallic elements may also be oxidized by solutions of other metal salts; for example: Cu(s) + 2AgNO3(aq) ⟶Cu (NO3)2(aq) + 2Ag(s) This reaction may be observed by placing copper wire in a solution containing a dissolved silver salt. Silver ions in Cu2+ solution are reduced to elemental silver at the surface of the copper wire, and the resulting ions dissolve in the (Figure 4.8). solution to yield a characteristic blue color Figure 4.8 (a) A copper wire is shown next to a solution containing silver(I) ions. (b) Displacement of dissolved silver ions by copper ions results in (c) accumulation of gray-colored silver metal on the wire and development of a blue color in the solution, due to dissolved copper ions.

It is a particularly interesting process, as it involves the same element, oxygen, undergoing both oxidation and reduction (a so-called disproportionation reaction).

Balancing Redox Reactions via the Half-Reaction Method Redox reactions that take place in aqueous media often involve water, hydronium ions, and hydroxide ions as reactants or products. Although these species are not oxidized or reduced, they do participate in chemical change in other ways (e.g., by providing the elements required to form oxyanions). Equations representing these reactions are sometimes very difficult to balance by inspection, so systematic approaches have been developed to assist in the process. One very useful approach is to use the method of half-reactions, which involves the following steps: 1. Write the two half-reactions representing the redox process. 2. Balance all elements except oxygen and hydrogen. 3. Balance oxygen atoms by adding H2O molecules. H+ 4. Balance hydrogen atoms by adding ions. charge[1] 5. Balance by adding electrons. 6. If necessary, multiply each half-reaction’s coefficients by the smallest possible integers to yield equal numbers of electrons in each. 1. The requirement of “charge balance” is just a specific type of “mass balance” in which the species in question are electrons. An equation must represent equal numbers of electrons on the reactant and product sides, and so both atoms and charges must be balanced.

196 Chapter 4 | Stoichiometry of Chemical Reactions 4.3 Reaction Stoichiometry By the end of this section, you will be able to: Explain the concept of stoichiometry as it pertains to chemical reactions • Use balanced chemical equations to derive stoichiometric factors relating amounts of reactants and • products Perform stoichiometric calculations involving mass, moles, and solution molarity • A balanced chemical equation provides a great deal of information in a very succinct format. Chemical formulas provide the identities of the reactants and products involved in the chemical change, allowing classification of the reaction. Coefficients provide the relative numbers of these chemical species, allowing a quantitative assessment of the relationships between the amounts of substances consumed and produced by the reaction. These quantitative relationships are known as the reaction’s stoichiometry, a term derived from the Greek words stoicheion (meaning “element”) and metron (meaning “measure”). In this module, the use of balanced chemical equations for various stoichiometric applications is explored. The general approach to using stoichiometric relationships is similar in concept to the way people go about many common activities. Food preparation, for example, offers an appropriate comparison. A recipe for making eight 3 pancakes calls for 1 cup pancake mix, cup milk, and one egg. The “equation” representing the preparation of 4 pancakes per this recipe is 3 1 cup mix + cup milk + 1 egg ⟶8 pancakes 4 If two dozen pancakes are needed for a big family breakfast, the ingredient amounts must be increased proportionally according to the amounts given in the recipe. For example, the number of eggs required to make 24 pancakes is 1 egg 24 pancakes × = 3 eggs 8 pancakes Balanced chemical equations are used in much the same fashion to determine the amount of one reactant required to react with a given amount of another reactant, or to yield a given amount of product, and so forth. The coefficients in the balanced equation are used to derive stoichiometric factors that permit computation of the desired quantity. To illustrate this idea, consider the production of ammonia by reaction of hydrogen and nitrogen: N2(g) + 3H2(g) ⟶2NH3(g) This equation shows ammonia molecules are produced from hydrogen molecules in a 2:3 ratio, and stoichiometric factors may be derived using any amount (number) unit: 2 NH3 molecules 2 doz NH3 molecules 2 mol NH3 molecules or or 3 H2 molecules 3 doz H2 molecules 3 mol H2 molecules These stoichiometric factors can be used to compute the number of ammonia molecules produced from a given number of hydrogen molecules, or the number of hydrogen molecules required to produce a given number of ammonia molecules. Similar factors may be derived for any pair of substances in any chemical equation.

Directly measuring numbers of atoms and molecules is, however, not an easy task, and the practical application of stoichiometry requires that we use the more readily measured property of mass.

200 Chapter 4 | Stoichiometry of Chemical Reactions Figure 4.10 The flowchart depicts the various computational steps involved in most reaction stoichiometry calculations. Chemistry in Everyday Life Airbags Airbags (Figure 4.11) are a safety feature provided in most automobiles since the 1990s. The effective operation of an airbag requires that it be rapidly inflated with an appropriate amount (volume) of gas when the vehicle is involved in a collision. This requirement is satisfied in many automotive airbag systems through use of explosive chemical reactions, one common choice being the decomposition of sodium azide, NaN3. When sensors in the vehicle detect a collision, an electrical current is passed through a carefully measured amount of NaN3 to initiate its decomposition: 2NaN3(s) ⟶3N2(g) 2Na(s) + This reaction is very rapid, generating gaseous nitrogen that can deploy and fully inflate a typical airbag in a fraction of a second (~0.03–0.1 s). Among many engineering considerations, the amount of sodium azide used must be appropriate for generating enough nitrogen gas to fully inflate the air bag and ensure its proper function. For example, a small mass (~100 g) of NaN3 will generate approximately 50 L of N2. https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

Chapter 4 | Stoichiometry of Chemical Reactions 201 Figure 4.11 Airbags deploy upon impact to minimize serious injuries to passengers. (credit: Jon Seidman) 4.4 Reaction Yields By the end of this section, you will be able to: Explain the concepts of theoretical yield and limiting reactants/reagents. • Derive the theoretical yield for a reaction under specified conditions. • Calculate the percent yield for a reaction. • The relative amounts of reactants and products represented in a balanced chemical equation are often referred to as stoichiometric amounts. All the exercises of the preceding module involved stoichiometric amounts of reactants. For example, when calculating the amount of product generated from a given amount of reactant, it was assumed that any other reactants required were available in stoichiometric amounts (or greater). In this module, more realistic situations are considered, in which reactants are not present in stoichiometric amounts. Limiting Reactant (Figure 4.12): Consider another food analogy, making grilled cheese sandwiches 1 slice of cheese + 2 slices of bread ⟶1 sandwich Stoichiometric amounts of sandwich ingredients for this recipe are bread and cheese slices in a 2:1 ratio. Provided with 28 slices of bread and 11 slices of cheese, one may prepare 11 sandwiches per the provided recipe, using all the provided cheese and having six slices of bread left over. In this scenario, the number of sandwiches prepared has been limited by the number of cheese slices, and the bread slices have been provided in excess. 

--- Page 210 ---
202 Chapter 4 | Stoichiometry of Chemical Reactions Figure 4.12 Sandwich making can illustrate the concepts of limiting and excess reactants. Consider this concept now with regard to a chemical process, the reaction of hydrogen with chlorine to yield hydrogen chloride: Cl2(g) ⟶2HCl(g) H2(s) + The balanced equation shows the hydrogen and chlorine react in a 1:1 stoichiometric ratio. If these reactants are provided in any other amounts, one of the reactants will nearly always be entirely consumed, thus limiting the amount of product that may be generated. This substance is the limiting reactant, and the other substance is the excess reactant. Identifying the limiting and excess reactants for a given situation requires computing the molar amounts of each reactant provided and comparing them to the stoichiometric amounts represented in the balanced chemical equation. For example, imagine combining 3 moles of H2 and 2 moles of Cl2. This represents a 3:2 (or 1.5:1) ratio of hydrogen to chlorine present for reaction, which is greater than the stoichiometric ratio of 1:1. Hydrogen, therefore, is present in excess, and chlorine is the limiting reactant. Reaction of all the provided chlorine (2 mol) will consume 2 mol of the 3 mol of hydrogen provided, leaving 1 mol of hydrogen unreacted. An alternative approach to identifying the limiting reactant involves comparing the amount of product expected for the complete reaction of each reactant. Each reactant amount is used to separately calculate the amount of product that would be formed per the reaction’s stoichiometry. The reactant yielding the lesser amount of product is the limiting reactant. For the example in the previous paragraph, complete reaction of the hydrogen would yield 2 mol HCl mol HCl produced = 3 mol H2 × = 6 mol HCl 1 mol H2 Complete reaction of the provided chlorine would produce 2 mol HCl mol HCl produced = 2 mol Cl2 × = 4 mol HCl 1 mol Cl2 The chlorine will be completely consumed once 4 moles of HCl have been produced. Since enough hydrogen was provided to yield 6 moles of HCl, there will be unreacted hydrogen remaining once this reaction is complete. (Figure 4.13). Chlorine, therefore, is the limiting reactant and hydrogen is the excess reactant https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

Alternatively, compute the amount of product expected for complete reaction of each of the provided reactants. The 0.0712 moles of silicon would yield 1 mol Si3 N4 mol Si3 N4 produced = 0.0712 mol Si × = 0.0237 mol Si3 N4 3 mol Si while the 0.0535 moles of nitrogen would produce 1 mol Si3 N4 mol Si3 N4 produced = 0.0535 mol N2 × = 0.0268 mol Si3 N4 2 mol N2 Since silicon yields the lesser amount of product, it is the limiting reactant. Check Your Learning Which is the limiting reactant when 5.00 g of H2 and 10.0 g of O2 react and form water? Answer: O2 Percent Yield The amount of product that may be produced by a reaction under specified conditions, as calculated per the stoichiometry of an appropriate balanced chemical equation, is called the theoretical yield of the reaction. In practice, the amount of product obtained is called the actual yield, and it is often less than the theoretical yield for a number of reasons. Some reactions are inherently inefficient, being accompanied by side reactions that generate other products. Others are, by nature, incomplete (consider the partial reactions of weak acids and bases discussed earlier in this chapter). Some products are difficult to collect without some loss, and so less than perfect recovery will reduce the actual yield. The extent to which a reaction’s theoretical yield is achieved is commonly expressed as its percent yield: actual yield 100% percent yield = × theoretical yield Actual and theoretical yields may be expressed as masses or molar amounts (or any other appropriate property; e.g., volume, if the product is a gas). As long as both yields are expressed using the same units, these units will cancel when percent yield is calculated. Example 4.13 Calculation of Percent Yield Upon reaction of 1.274 g of copper sulfate with excess zinc metal, 0.392 g copper metal was obtained according to the equation: CuSO4(aq) + Zn(s) ⟶Cu(s) + ZnSO4(aq) What is the percent yield?

CCl4 + 2HF ⟶CF2 Cl2 + 2HCl Answer: 48.3% How Sciences Interconnect Green Chemistry and Atom Economy The purposeful design of chemical products and processes that minimize the use of environmentally hazardous substances and the generation of waste is known as green chemistry. Green chemistry is a philosophical approach that is being applied to many areas of science and technology, and its practice is summarized by guidelines known as the “Twelve Principles of Green Chemistry” (see details at this website (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/16greenchem) ). One of the 12 principles is aimed specifically at maximizing the efficiency of processes for synthesizing chemical products. The atom economy of a process is a measure of this efficiency, defined as the percentage by mass of the final product of a synthesis relative to the masses of all the reactants used: mass of product atom economy = × 100% mass of reactants Though the definition of atom economy at first glance appears very similar to that for percent yield, be aware that this property represents a difference in the theoretical efficiencies of different chemical processes. The percent yield of a given chemical process, on the other hand, evaluates the efficiency of a process by comparing the yield of product actually obtained to the maximum yield predicted by stoichiometry. The synthesis of the common nonprescription pain medication, ibuprofen, nicely illustrates the success of a green chemistry approach (Figure 4.14). First marketed in the early 1960s, ibuprofen was produced using a six-step synthesis that required 514 g of reactants to generate each mole (206 g) of ibuprofen, an atom economy of 40%. In the 1990s, an alternative process was developed by the BHC Company (now BASF Corporation) that requires only three steps and has an atom economy of ~80%, nearly twice that of the original process. The BHC process generates significantly less chemical waste; uses less-hazardous and recyclable materials; and provides significant cost-savings to the manufacturer (and, subsequently, the consumer). In recognition of the positive environmental impact of the BHC process, the company received the Environmental Protection Agency’s Greener Synthetic Pathways Award in 1997.

The greater the weight of potassium carbonate added to reach the point where the bubbling ended, the more concentrated the vinegar. We now know that the effervescence that occurred during this process was due to reaction with acetic acid, CH3CO2H, the compound primarily responsible for the odor and taste of vinegar. Acetic acid reacts with potassium carbonate according to the following equation: https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at 

--- Page 215 ---
Chapter 4 | Stoichiometry of Chemical Reactions 207 2CH3 CO2 H(aq) + K2 CO3(s) ⟶KCH3 CO3(aq) + CO2(g) + H2 O(l) The bubbling was due to the production of CO2. The test of vinegar with potassium carbonate is one type of quantitative analysis—the determination of the amount or concentration of a substance in a sample. In the analysis of vinegar, the concentration of the solute (acetic acid) was determined from the amount of reactant that combined with the solute present in a known volume of the solution. In other types of chemical analyses, the amount of a substance present in a sample is determined by measuring the amount of product that results. Titration The described approach to measuring vinegar strength was an early version of the analytical technique known as (Figure 4.15) titration analysis. A typical titration analysis involves the use of a buret to make incremental additions of a solution containing a known concentration of some substance (the titrant) to a sample solution containing the substance whose concentration is to be measured (the analyte). The titrant and analyte undergo a chemical reaction of known stoichiometry, and so measuring the volume of titrant solution required for complete reaction with the analyte (the equivalence point of the titration) allows calculation of the analyte concentration. The equivalence point of a titration may be detected visually if a distinct change in the appearance of the sample solution accompanies the completion of the reaction. The halt of bubble formation in the classic vinegar analysis is one such example, though, more commonly, special dyes called indicators are added to the sample solutions to impart a change in color at or very near the equivalence point of the titration. Equivalence points may also be detected by measuring some solution property that changes in a predictable way during the course of the titration. Regardless of the approach taken to detect a titration’s equivalence point, the volume of titrant actually measured is called the end point. Properly designed titration methods typically ensure that the difference between the equivalence and end points is negligible. Though any type of chemical reaction may serve as the basis for a titration analysis, the three described in this chapter (precipitation, acid-base, and redox) are most common. Additional details regarding titration analysis are provided in the chapter on acid-base equilibria.

What is the oxalic acid molarity? Answer: 0.2648 M Gravimetric Analysis A gravimetric analysis is one in which a sample is subjected to some treatment that causes a change in the physical state of the analyte that permits its separation from the other components of the sample. Mass measurements of the sample, the isolated analyte, or some other component of the analysis system, used along with the known stoichiometry of the compounds involved, permit calculation of the analyte concentration. Gravimetric methods were the first techniques used for quantitative chemical analysis, and they remain important tools in the modern chemistry laboratory. 

--- Page 218 ---
210 Chapter 4 | Stoichiometry of Chemical Reactions The required change of state in a gravimetric analysis may be achieved by various physical and chemical processes. For example, the moisture (water) content of a sample is routinely determined by measuring the mass of a sample before and after it is subjected to a controlled heating process that evaporates the water. Also common are gravimetric techniques in which the analyte is subjected to a precipitation reaction of the sort described earlier in this chapter. (Figure The precipitate is typically isolated from the reaction mixture by filtration, carefully dried, and then weighed 4.16). The mass of the precipitate may then be used, along with relevant stoichiometric relationships, to calculate analyte concentration. Figure 4.16 Precipitate may be removed from a reaction mixture by filtration.

In a combustion analysis, a weighed sample of the compound is heated to a high temperature under a stream of oxygen gas, resulting in its complete combustion to yield gaseous products of known identities. The complete combustion of hydrocarbons, for example, will yield carbon dioxide and water as the only products. The gaseous combustion products are swept through separate, preweighed collection devices containing (Figure 4.17). compounds that selectively absorb each product The mass increase of each device corresponds to the mass of the absorbed product and may be used in an appropriate stoichiometric calculation to derive the mass of the relevant element.

Formulas for the substances undergoing the change (reactants) and substances generated by the change (products) are separated by an arrow and preceded by integer coefficients indicating their relative numbers. Balanced equations are those whose coefficients result in equal numbers of atoms for each element in the reactants and products. Chemical reactions in aqueous solution that involve ionic reactants or products may be represented more realistically by complete ionic equations and, more succinctly, by net ionic equations. 4.2 Classifying Chemical Reactions Chemical reactions are classified according to similar patterns of behavior. A large number of important reactions are included in three categories: precipitation, acid-base, and oxidation-reduction (redox). Precipitation reactions involve the formation of one or more insoluble products. Acid-base reactions involve the transfer of hydrogen ions between reactants. Redox reactions involve a change in oxidation number for one or more reactant elements. Writing balanced equations for some redox reactions that occur in aqueous solutions is simplified by using a systematic approach called the half-reaction method. 4.3 Reaction Stoichiometry A balanced chemical equation may be used to describe a reaction’s stoichiometry (the relationships between amounts of reactants and products). Coefficients from the equation are used to derive stoichiometric factors that subsequently may be used for computations relating reactant and product masses, molar amounts, and other quantitative properties. 4.4 Reaction Yields When reactions are carried out using less-than-stoichiometric quantities of reactants, the amount of product generated will be determined by the limiting reactant. The amount of product generated by a chemical reaction is its actual yield. This yield is often less than the amount of product predicted by the stoichiometry of the balanced chemical equation representing the reaction (its theoretical yield). The extent to which a reaction generates the theoretical amount of product is expressed as its percent yield. 4.5 Quantitative Chemical Analysis The stoichiometry of chemical reactions may serve as the basis for quantitative chemical analysis methods. Titrations involve measuring the volume of a titrant solution required to completely react with a sample solution. This volume is then used to calculate the concentration of analyte in the sample using the stoichiometry of the titration reaction. Gravimetric analysis involves separating the analyte from the sample by a physical or chemical process, determining its mass, and then calculating its concentration in the sample based on the stoichiometry of the relevant process. Combustion analysis is a gravimetric method used to determine the elemental composition of a compound by collecting and weighing the gaseous products of its combustion. https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

(credit: modification of work by Laszlo Ilyes) Chapter Outline 5.1 Energy Basics 5.2 Calorimetry 5.3 Enthalpy Introduction Chemical reactions, such as those that occur when you light a match, involve changes in energy as well as matter. Societies at all levels of development could not function without the energy released by chemical reactions. In 2012, about 85% of US energy consumption came from the combustion of petroleum products, coal, wood, and garbage. We use this energy to produce electricity (38%); to transport food, raw materials, manufactured goods, and people (27%); (10%).[1] for industrial production (21%); and to heat and power our homes and businesses While these combustion reactions help us meet our essential energy needs, they are also recognized by the majority of the scientific community as a major contributor to global climate change. Useful forms of energy are also available from a variety of chemical reactions other than combustion. For example, the energy produced by the batteries in a cell phone, car, or flashlight results from chemical reactions. This chapter introduces many of the basic ideas necessary to explore the relationships between chemical changes and energy, with a focus on thermal energy. 1.

232 Chapter 5 | Thermochemistry 5.1 Energy Basics By the end of this section, you will be able to: Define energy, distinguish types of energy, and describe the nature of energy changes that accompany • chemical and physical changes Distinguish the related properties of heat, thermal energy, and temperature • Define and distinguish specific heat and heat capacity, and describe the physical implications of both • Perform calculations involving heat, specific heat, and temperature change • (Figure Chemical changes and their accompanying changes in energy are important parts of our everyday world 5.2). The macronutrients in food (proteins, fats, and carbohydrates) undergo metabolic reactions that provide the energy to keep our bodies functioning. We burn a variety of fuels (gasoline, natural gas, coal) to produce energy for transportation, heating, and the generation of electricity. Industrial chemical reactions use enormous amounts of energy to produce raw materials (such as iron and aluminum). Energy is then used to manufacture those raw materials into useful products, such as cars, skyscrapers, and bridges. Figure 5.2 The energy involved in chemical changes is important to our daily lives: (a) A cheeseburger for lunch provides the energy you need to get through the rest of the day; (b) the combustion of gasoline provides the energy that moves your car (and you) between home, work, and school; and (c) coke, a processed form of coal, provides the energy needed to convert iron ore into iron, which is essential for making many of the products we use daily. (credit a: modification of work by “Pink Sherbet Photography”/Flickr; credit b: modification of work by Jeffery Turner) Over 90% of the energy we use comes originally from the sun. Every day, the sun provides the earth with almost 10,000 times the amount of energy necessary to meet all of the world’s energy needs for that day. Our challenge is to find ways to convert and store incoming solar energy so that it can be used in reactions or chemical processes that are both convenient and nonpolluting. Plants and many bacteria capture solar energy through photosynthesis. We release the energy stored in plants when we burn wood or plant products such as ethanol. We also use this energy to fuel our bodies by eating food that comes directly from plants or from animals that got their energy by eating plants. Burning coal and petroleum also releases stored solar energy: These fuels are fossilized plant and animal matter. This chapter will introduce the basic ideas of an important area of science concerned with the amount of heat absorbed or released during chemical and physical changes—an area called thermochemistry. The concepts introduced in this chapter are widely used in almost all scientific and technical fields. Food scientists use them to determine the energy content of foods. Biologists study the energetics of living organisms, such as the metabolic combustion of sugar into carbon dioxide and water. The oil, gas, and transportation industries, renewable energy providers, and many others endeavor to find better methods to produce energy for our commercial and personal needs. Engineers strive to improve energy efficiency, find better ways to heat and cool our homes, refrigerate our food and drinks, and meet the energy and cooling needs of computers and electronics, among other applications.

Chapter 5 | Thermochemistry 233 principles is essential for chemists, physicists, biologists, geologists, every type of engineer, and just about anyone who studies or does any kind of science. Energy Energy can be defined as the capacity to supply heat or do work. One type of work (w) is the process of causing matter to move against an opposing force. For example, we do work when we inflate a bicycle tire—we move matter (the air in the pump) against the opposing force of the air already in the tire. Like matter, energy comes in different types. One scheme classifies energy into two types: potential energy, the energy an object has because of its relative position, composition, or condition, and kinetic energy, the energy that an object possesses because of its motion. Water at the top of a waterfall or dam has potential energy because of its position; when it flows downward through generators, it has kinetic energy that can be used to do work and produce (Figure 5.3). electricity in a hydroelectric plant A battery has potential energy because the chemicals within it can produce electricity that can do work. Figure 5.3 (a) Water that is higher in elevation, for example, at the top of Victoria Falls, has a higher potential energy than water at a lower elevation. As the water falls, some of its potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. (b) If the water flows through generators at the bottom of a dam, such as the Hoover Dam shown here, its kinetic energy is converted into electrical energy. (credit a: modification of work by Steve Jurvetson; credit b: modification of work by “curimedia”/Wikimedia commons) Energy can be converted from one form into another, but all of the energy present before a change occurs always exists in some form after the change is completed. This observation is expressed in the law of conservation of energy: during a chemical or physical change, energy can be neither created nor destroyed, although it can be changed in form. (This is also one version of the first law of thermodynamics, as you will learn later.) When one substance is converted into another, there is always an associated conversion of one form of energy into another. Heat is usually released or absorbed, but sometimes the conversion involves light, electrical energy, or some other form of energy. For example, chemical energy (a type of potential energy) is stored in the molecules that compose gasoline. When gasoline is combusted within the cylinders of a car’s engine, the rapidly expanding gaseous products of this chemical reaction generate mechanical energy (a type of kinetic energy) when they move the cylinders’ pistons. According to the law of conservation of matter (seen in an earlier chapter), there is no detectable change in the total amount of matter during a chemical change. When chemical reactions occur, the energy changes are relatively modest and the mass changes are too small to measure, so the laws of conservation of matter and energy hold well. However, in nuclear reactions, the energy changes are much larger (by factors of a million or so), the mass changes

234 Chapter 5 | Thermochemistry are measurable, and matter-energy conversions are significant. This will be examined in more detail in a later chapter on nuclear chemistry. To encompass both chemical and nuclear changes, we combine these laws into one statement: The total quantity of matter and energy in the universe is fixed. Thermal Energy, Temperature, and Heat Thermal energy is kinetic energy associated with the random motion of atoms and molecules. Temperature is a quantitative measure of “hot” or “cold.” When the atoms and molecules in an object are moving or vibrating quickly, they have a higher average kinetic energy (KE), and we say that the object is “hot.” When the atoms and molecules are (Figure 5.4). moving slowly, they have lower KE, and we say that the object is “cold” Assuming that no chemical reaction or phase change (such as melting or vaporizing) occurs, increasing the amount of thermal energy in a sample of matter will cause its temperature to increase. And, assuming that no chemical reaction or phase change (such as condensation or freezing) occurs, decreasing the amount of thermal energy in a sample of matter will cause its temperature to decrease. Figure 5.4 (a) The molecules in a sample of hot water move more rapidly than (b) those in a sample of cold water.

(b) In a bimetallic thermometer, two different metals (such as brass and steel) form a two-layered strip. When heated or cooled, one of the metals (brass) expands or contracts more than the other metal (steel), causing the strip to coil or uncoil. Both types of thermometers have a calibrated scale that indicates the temperature.

Heat (q) is the transfer of thermal energy between two bodies at different temperatures. Heat flow (a redundant term, but one commonly used) increases the thermal energy of one body and decreases the thermal energy of the other. Suppose we initially have a high temperature (and high thermal energy) substance (H) and a low temperature (and low thermal energy) substance (L). The atoms and molecules in H have a higher average KE than those in L. If we place substance H in contact with substance L, the thermal energy will flow spontaneously from substance H to substance L. The temperature of substance H will decrease, as will the average KE of its molecules; the temperature of substance L will increase, along with the average KE of its molecules. Heat flow will continue until the two substances are at (Figure 5.6). the same temperature

(b) When they are put into contact with each other, collisions between the molecules result in the transfer of kinetic (thermal) energy from the hotter to the cooler matter.

Visit the Energy Systems tab to create combinations of energy sources, transformation methods, and outputs. Click on Energy Symbols to visualize the transfer of energy. Matter undergoing chemical reactions and physical changes can release or absorb heat. A change that releases heat is called an exothermic process. For example, the combustion reaction that occurs when using an oxyacetylene torch is an exothermic process—this process also releases energy in the form of light as evidenced by the torch’s flame (Figure 5.7). A reaction or change that absorbs heat is an endothermic process. A cold pack used to treat muscle strains provides an example of an endothermic process. When the substances in the cold pack (water and a salt like ammonium nitrate) are brought together, the resulting process absorbs heat, leading to the sensation of cold. https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

(credit a: modification of work by “Skatebiker”/Wikimedia commons) Historically, energy was measured in units of calories (cal). A calorie is the amount of energy required to raise one gram of water by 1 degree C (1 kelvin). However, this quantity depends on the atmospheric pressure and the starting temperature of the water. The ease of measurement of energy changes in calories has meant that the calorie is still frequently used. The Calorie (with a capital C), or large calorie, commonly used in quantifying food energy content, is a kilocalorie. The SI unit of heat, work, and energy is the joule. A joule (J) is defined as the amount of energy used when a force of 1 newton moves an object 1 meter. It is named in honor of the English physicist James Prescott m2/s2, Joule. One joule is equivalent to 1 kg which is also called 1 newton–meter. A kilojoule (kJ) is 1000 joules. To standardize its definition, 1 calorie has been set to equal 4.184 joules. We now introduce two concepts useful in describing heat flow and temperature change. The heat capacity (C) of a body of matter is the quantity of heat (q) it absorbs or releases when it experiences a temperature change (ΔT) of 1 degree Celsius (or equivalently, 1 kelvin): q C = ΔT Heat capacity is determined by both the type and amount of substance that absorbs or releases heat. It is therefore an extensive property—its value is proportional to the amount of the substance. For example, consider the heat capacities of two cast iron frying pans. The heat capacity of the large pan is five times greater than that of the small pan because, although both are made of the same material, the mass of the large pan is five times greater than the mass of the small pan. More mass means more atoms are present in the larger pan, so it takes more energy to make all of those atoms vibrate faster. The heat capacity of the small cast iron frying pan is found by observing that it takes 18,150 J of energy to raise the temperature of the pan by 50.0 °C: 18,140 J Csmall = = 363 J/°C pan 50.0 °C The larger cast iron frying pan, while made of the same substance, requires 90,700 J of energy to raise its temperature by 50.0 °C. The larger pan has a (proportionally) larger heat capacity because the larger amount of material requires a (proportionally) larger amount of energy to yield the same temperature change: 90,700 J Clarge = = 1814 J/°C pan 50.0 °C 

--- Page 246 ---
238 Chapter 5 | Thermochemistry The specific heat capacity (c) of a substance, commonly called its “specific heat,” is the quantity of heat required to raise the temperature of 1 gram of a substance by 1 degree Celsius (or 1 kelvin): q c = mΔT Specific heat capacity depends only on the kind of substance absorbing or releasing heat. It is an intensive property—the type, but not the amount, of the substance is all that matters. For example, the small cast iron frying pan has a mass of 808 g. The specific heat of iron (the material used to make the pan) is therefore: 18,140 J ciron = = 0.449 J/g °C (808 g)(50.0 °C) The large frying pan has a mass of 4040 g. Using the data for this pan, we can also calculate the specific heat of iron: 90,700 J ciron = = 0.449 J/g °C (4040 g)(50.0 °C) Although the large pan is more massive than the small pan, since both are made of the same material, they both yield the same value for specific heat (for the material of construction, iron). Note that specific heat is measured in units of energy per temperature per mass and is an intensive property, being derived from a ratio of two extensive properties (heat and mass). The molar heat capacity, also an intensive property, is the heat capacity per mole of a particular (Figure 5.8). substance and has units of J/mol °C Figure 5.8 Due to its larger mass, a large frying pan has a larger heat capacity than a small frying pan. Because they are made of the same material, both frying pans have the same specific heat. (credit: Mark Blaser) Liquid water has a relatively high specific heat (about 4.2 J/g °C); most metals have much lower specific heats (usually less than 1 J/g °C). The specific heat of a substance varies somewhat with temperature. However, this variation is usually small enough that we will treat specific heat as constant over the range of temperatures that will Table 5.1. be considered in this chapter.

If a substance gains thermal energy, its temperature increases, its final temperature is higher than its initial temperature, Tfinal −Tinitial has a positive value, and the value of q is positive. If a substance loses thermal energy, its temperature decreases, the final temperature is lower than the initial temperature, Tfinal −Tinitial has a negative value, and the value of q is negative. Example 5.1 Measuring Heat 102 × A flask containing 8.0 g of water is heated, and the temperature of the water increases from 21 °C to 85 °C. How much heat did the water absorb? Solution To answer this question, consider these factors: the specific heat of the substance being heated (in this case, water) • the amount of substance being heated (in this case, 800 g) • 

--- Page 248 ---
240 Chapter 5 | Thermochemistry the magnitude of the temperature change (in this case, from 20 °C to 85 °C). • The specific heat of water is 4.184 J/g °C, so to heat 1 g of water by 1 °C requires 4.184 J. We note that since 4.184 J is required to heat 1 g of water by 1 °C, we will need 800 times as much to heat 800 g of water by 1 °C. Finally, we observe that since 4.184 J are required to heat 1 g of water by 1 °C, we will need 64 times as much to heat it by 65 °C (that is, from 21 °C to 85 °C). This can be summarized using the equation: q = c × m × ΔT = c × m × (Tfina −Tinitial) = (4.184 J/g °C) × (800 g) × (85 −20) °C = (4.184 J/g °C) × (800 g) × (65) °C = 220,000 J ( = 210 kJ) Because the temperature increased, the water absorbed heat and q is positive.

Determine the specific heat of this metal (which might provide a clue to its identity). Solution Since mass, heat, and temperature change are known for this metal, we can determine its specific heat using the relationship: q = c × m × ΔT = c × m × (Tfina −Tinitial) Substituting the known values: 6640 J = c × (348 g) × (43.6 −22.4) °C Solving: 6640 J c = = 0.900 J/g °C g) × (21.2 °C) (348 Table 5.1, Comparing this value with the values in this value matches the specific heat of aluminum, which suggests that the unknown metal may be aluminum.

Chapter 5 | Thermochemistry 241 Chemistry in Everyday Life Solar Thermal Energy Power Plants The sunlight that reaches the earth contains thousands of times more energy than we presently capture. Solar thermal systems provide one possible solution to the problem of converting energy from the sun into energy we can use. Large-scale solar thermal plants have different design specifics, but all concentrate sunlight to heat some substance; the heat “stored” in that substance is then converted into electricity. The Solana Generating Station in Arizona’s Sonora Desert produces 280 megawatts of electrical power. It uses parabolic mirrors that focus sunlight on pipes filled with a heat transfer fluid (HTF) (Figure 5.9). The HTF then does two things: It turns water into steam, which spins turbines, which in turn produces electricity, and it melts and heats a mixture of salts, which functions as a thermal energy storage system. After the sun goes down, the molten salt mixture can then release enough of its stored heat to produce steam to run the turbines for 6 hours. Molten salts are used because they possess a number of beneficial properties, including high heat capacities and thermal conductivities. Figure 5.9 This solar thermal plant uses parabolic trough mirrors to concentrate sunlight. (credit a: modification of work by Bureau of Land Management) The 377-megawatt Ivanpah Solar Generating System, located in the Mojave Desert in California, is the largest solar thermal power plant in the world (Figure 5.10). Its 170,000 mirrors focus huge amounts of sunlight on three water-filled towers, producing steam at over 538 °C that drives electricity-producing turbines. It produces enough energy to power 140,000 homes. Water is used as the working fluid because of its large heat capacity and heat of vaporization.

Calorimetry is used to measure amounts of heat transferred to or from a substance. To do so, the heat is exchanged with a calibrated object (calorimeter). The change in temperature of the measuring part of the calorimeter is converted into the amount of heat (since the previous calibration was used to establish its heat capacity). The measurement of heat transfer using this approach requires the definition of a system (the substance or substances undergoing the chemical or physical change) and its surroundings (the other components of the measurement apparatus that serve to either provide heat to the system or absorb heat from the system). Knowledge of the heat capacity of the surroundings, and careful measurements of the masses of the system and surroundings and their temperatures before and after the process allows one to calculate the heat transferred as described in this section. A calorimeter is a device used to measure the amount of heat involved in a chemical or physical process. For example, when an exothermic reaction occurs in solution in a calorimeter, the heat produced by the reaction is absorbed by the solution, which increases its temperature. When an endothermic reaction occurs, the heat required is (Figure 5.11). absorbed from the thermal energy of the solution, which decreases its temperature The temperature specific heat and mass of the solution, can then be used to calculate the amount of heat change, along with the involved in either case. https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

Chapter 5 | Thermochemistry 243 Figure 5.11 In a calorimetric determination, either (a) an exothermic process occurs and heat, q, is negative, indicating that thermal energy is transferred from the system to its surroundings, or (b) an endothermic process occurs and heat, q, is positive, indicating that thermal energy is transferred from the surroundings to the system. Scientists use well-insulated calorimeters that all but prevent the transfer of heat between the calorimeter and its environment. This enables the accurate determination of the heat involved in chemical processes, the energy content of foods, and so on. General chemistry students often use simple calorimeters constructed from polystyrene cups (Figure 5.12). These easy-to-use “coffee cup” calorimeters allow more heat exchange with their surroundings, and therefore produce less accurate energy values.

244 Chapter 5 | Thermochemistry Figure 5.12 A simple calorimeter can be constructed from two polystyrene cups. A thermometer and stirrer extend through the cover into the reaction mixture. Commercial solution calorimeters are also available. Relatively inexpensive calorimeters often consist of two thin- walled cups that are nested in a way that minimizes thermal contact during use, along with an insulated cover, handheld stirrer, and simple thermometer. More expensive calorimeters used for industry and research typically have a well-insulated, fully enclosed reaction vessel, motorized stirring mechanism, and a more accurate temperature sensor (Figure 5.13). https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

Chapter 5 | Thermochemistry 245 Figure 5.13 Commercial solution calorimeters range from (a) simple, inexpensive models for student use to (b) expensive, more accurate models for industry and research. Before we practice calorimetry problems involving chemical reactions, consider a simpler example that illustrates the core idea behind calorimetry. Suppose we initially have a high-temperature substance, such as a hot piece of metal (M), and a low-temperature substance, such as cool water (W). If we place the metal in the water, heat will flow from M to W. The temperature of M will decrease, and the temperature of W will increase, until the two substances have (Figure 5.14). the same temperature—that is, when they reach thermal equilibrium If this occurs in a calorimeter, ideally all of this heat transfer occurs between the two substances, with no heat gained or lost by either the calorimeter or the calorimeter’s surroundings. Under these ideal circumstances, the net heat change is zero: qsubstance + qsubstance = 0 M W This relationship can be rearranged to show that the heat gained by substance M is equal to the heat lost by substance W: qsubstance = −qsubstance M W The magnitude of the heat (change) is therefore the same for both substances, and the negative sign merely shows that qsubstance and qsubstance are opposite in direction of heat flow (gain or loss) but does not indicate the arithmetic M W sign of either q value (that is determined by whether the matter in question gains or loses heat, per definition). In the specific situation described, qsubstance is a negative value and qsubstance is positive, since heat is transferred from M W M to W. 

--- Page 254 ---
246 Chapter 5 | Thermochemistry Figure 5.14 In a simple calorimetry process, (a) heat, q, is transferred from the hot metal, M, to the cool water, W, until (b) both are at the same temperature. Example 5.3 Heat Transfer between Substances at Different Temperatures A 360-g piece of rebar (a steel rod used for reinforcing concrete) is dropped into 425 mL of water at 24.0 °C. The final temperature of the water was measured as 42.7 °C. Calculate the initial temperature of the piece (Table 5.1), of rebar. Assume the specific heat of steel is approximately the same as that for iron and that all heat transfer occurs between the rebar and the water (there is no heat exchange with the surroundings). Solution The temperature of the water increases from 24.0 °C to 42.7 °C, so the water absorbs heat. That heat came from the piece of rebar, which initially was at a higher temperature. Assuming that all heat transfer was between the rebar and the water, with no heat “lost” to the surroundings, then heat given off by rebar = −heat taken in by water, or: qrebar = −qwater Since we know how heat is related to other measurable quantities, we have: (c × m × ΔT)rebar = −(c × m × ΔT)water Letting f = final and i = initial, in expanded form, this becomes: crebar × mrebar × (Tf,rebar −Ti,rebar) = −cwater × mwater × (Tf,water −Ti,water) The density of water is 1.0 g/mL, so 425 mL of water = 425 g. Noting that the final temperature of both the rebar and water is 42.7 °C, substituting known values yields: ⎛ °C⎞ ⎛ g⎞ ⎛ ⎞ ⎛ °C⎞ ⎛ ⎝425g⎞ ⎛ °C⎞ ⎝0.449 J/g ⎝360 ⎝42.7 °C −Ti,rebar ⎠= ⎝4.184 J/g ⎝42.7 °C −24.0 ⎠ ⎠ ⎠ ⎠ ⎠ (4.184 J/g °C)(425 g)(42.7 °C −24.0 °C) Ti,rebar = + 42.7 °C (0.449 J/g °C)(360 g) https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

Chapter 5 | Thermochemistry 247 Solving this gives Ti,rebar= 248 °C, so the initial temperature of the rebar was 248 °C. Check Your Learning A 248-g piece of copper is dropped into 390 mL of water at 22.6 °C. The final temperature of the water was measured as 39.9 °C. Calculate the initial temperature of the piece of copper. Assume that all heat transfer occurs between the copper and the water. Answer: The initial temperature of the copper was 317 °C. Check Your Learning A 248-g piece of copper initially at 314 °C is dropped into 390 mL of water initially at 22.6 °C. Assuming that all heat transfer occurs between the copper and the water, calculate the final temperature. Answer: The final temperature (reached by both copper and water) is 38.8 °C. This method can also be used to determine other quantities, such as the specific heat of an unknown metal. Example 5.4 Identifying a Metal by Measuring Specific Heat A 59.7 g piece of metal that had been submerged in boiling water was quickly transferred into 60.0 mL of water initially at 22.0 °C. The final temperature is 28.5 °C. Use these data to determine the specific heat of the metal. Use this result to identify the metal. Solution Assuming perfect heat transfer, heat given off by metal = −heat taken in by water, or: qmetal = −qwater In expanded form, this is: cmetal × mmetal × (Tf,metal −Ti, metal) = −cwater × mwater × (Tf,water −Ti,water) Noting that since the metal was submerged in boiling water, its initial temperature was 100.0 °C; and that for water, 60.0 mL = 60.0 g; we have: (cmetal)(59.7 g)(28.5 °C −100.0 °C) = −(4.18 J/g °C)(60.0 g)(28.5 °C −22.0 °C) Solving this: −(4.184 J/g °C)(60.0 g)(6.5 °C) cmetal = = 0.38 J/g °C (59.7 g)(−71.5 °C) Table 5.1, Comparing this with values in our experimental specific heat is closest to the value for copper (0.39 J/g °C), so we identify the metal as copper. Check Your Learning A 92.9-g piece of a silver/gray metal is heated to 178.0 °C, and then quickly transferred into 75.0 mL of water initially at 24.0 °C. After 5 minutes, both the metal and the water have reached the same temperature: 29.7 °C. Determine the specific heat and the identity of the metal. (Note: You should find that the specific heat is close to that of two different metals. Explain how you can confidently determine the identity of the metal). Answer: cmetal= 0.13 J/g °C This specific heat is close to that of either gold or lead. It would be difficult to determine which metal this was based solely on the numerical values. However, the observation that the metal is silver/gray in addition to the value for the specific heat indicates that the metal is lead.

248 Chapter 5 | Thermochemistry When we use calorimetry to determine the heat involved in a chemical reaction, the same principles we have been discussing apply. The amount of heat absorbed by the calorimeter is often small enough that we can neglect it (though not for highly accurate measurements, as discussed later), and the calorimeter minimizes energy exchange with the surroundings. Because energy is neither created nor destroyed during a chemical reaction, there is no overall energy change during the reaction. The heat produced or consumed in the reaction (the “system”), qreaction, plus the heat absorbed or lost by the solution (the “surroundings”), qsolution, must add up to zero: qreaction + qsolution = 0 This means that the amount of heat produced or consumed in the reaction equals the amount of heat absorbed or lost by the solution: qreaction = −qsolution This concept lies at the heart of all calorimetry problems and calculations. Example 5.5 Heat Produced by an Exothermic Reaction When 50.0 mL of 0.10 M HCl(aq) and 50.0 mL of 0.10 M NaOH(aq), both at 22.0 °C, are added to a coffee cup calorimeter, the temperature of the mixture reaches a maximum of 28.9 °C. What is the approximate amount of heat produced by this reaction? H2 O(l) HCl(aq) + NaOH(aq) ⟶NaCl(aq) + Solution To visualize what is going on, imagine that you could combine the two solutions so quickly that no reaction took place while they mixed; then after mixing, the reaction took place. At the instant of mixing, you have 100.0 mL of a mixture of HCl and NaOH at 22.0 °C. The HCl and NaOH then react until the solution temperature reaches 28.9 °C. The heat given off by the reaction is equal to that taken in by the solution. Therefore: qreaction = −qsolution (It is important to remember that this relationship only holds if the calorimeter does not absorb any heat from the reaction, and there is no heat exchange between the calorimeter and its surroundings.) Next, we know that the heat absorbed by the solution depends on its specific heat, mass, and temperature change: qsolution = (c × m × ΔT)solution To proceed with this calculation, we need to make a few more reasonable assumptions or approximations. Since the solution is aqueous, we can proceed as if it were water in terms of its specific heat and mass 102 × values. The density of water is approximately 1.0 g/mL, so 100.0 mL has a mass of about 1.0 g (two significant figures). The specific heat of water is approximately 4.18 J/g °C, so we use that for the specific heat of the solution. Substituting these values gives: 103 102 qsolution = (4.184 J/g °C)(1.0 × g)(28.9 °C −22.0 °C) = 2.89 × J Finally, since we are trying to find the heat of the reaction, we have: 103 qreaction = −qsolution = −2.89 × J The negative sign indicates that the reaction is exothermic. It produces 2.89 kJ of heat. Check Your Learning https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

How much heat is produced by this precipitation reaction? What assumptions did you make to determine your value? 103 × Answer: 1.31 J; assume no heat is absorbed by the calorimeter, no heat is exchanged between the calorimeter and its surroundings, and that the specific heat and mass of the solution are the same as those for water Chemistry in Everyday Life Thermochemistry of Hand Warmers When working or playing outdoors on a cold day, you might use a hand warmer to warm your hands (Figure 5.15). A common reusable hand warmer contains a supersaturated solution of NaC2H3O2 (sodium acetate) and a metal disc. Bending the disk creates nucleation sites around which the metastable NaC2H3O2 quickly crystallizes (a later chapter on solutions will investigate saturation and supersaturation in more detail). NaC2 H3 O2(aq) ⟶NaC2 H3 O2(s) is exothermic, and the heat produced by this process is The process absorbed by your hands, thereby warming them (at least for a while). If the hand warmer is reheated, the NaC2H3O2 redissolves and can be reused. Figure 5.15 Chemical hand warmers produce heat that warms your hand on a cold day. In this one, you can see the metal disc that initiates the exothermic precipitation reaction. (credit: modification of work by Science Buddies TV/YouTube) Another common hand warmer produces heat when it is ripped open, exposing iron and water in the hand warmer to oxygen in the air. One simplified version of this exothermic reaction is 3 2Fe(s) + O2(g) ⟶Fe2 O3(s). Salt in the hand warmer catalyzes the reaction, so it produces heat more 2 rapidly; cellulose, vermiculite, and activated carbon help distribute the heat evenly. Other types of hand warmers use lighter fluid (a platinum catalyst helps lighter fluid oxidize exothermically), charcoal (charcoal oxidizes in a special case), or electrical units that produce heat by passing an electrical current from a battery through resistive wires.

Example 5.6 Heat Flow in an Instant Ice Pack When solid ammonium nitrate dissolves in water, the solution becomes cold. This is the basis for an “instant (Figure 5.16). ice pack” When 3.21 g of solid NH4NO3 dissolves in 50.0 g of water at 24.9 °C in a calorimeter, the temperature decreases to 20.3 °C. Calculate the value of q for this reaction and explain the meaning of its arithmetic sign. State any assumptions that you made. Figure 5.16 An instant cold pack consists of a bag containing solid ammonium nitrate and a second bag of water. When the bag of water is broken, the pack becomes cold because the dissolution of ammonium nitrate is an endothermic process that removes thermal energy from the water. The cold pack then removes thermal energy from your body.

How much heat is involved in the dissolution of the KCl? What assumptions did you make? Answer: 1.33 kJ; assume that the calorimeter prevents heat transfer between the solution and its external environment (including the calorimeter itself) and that the specific heat of the solution is the same as that for water If the amount of heat absorbed by a calorimeter is too large to neglect or if we require more accurate results, then we must take into account the heat absorbed both by the solution and by the calorimeter. The calorimeters described are designed to operate at constant (atmospheric) pressure and are convenient to measure heat flow accompanying processes that occur in solution. A different type of calorimeter that operates at constant volume, colloquially known as a bomb calorimeter, is used to measure the energy produced by reactions that yield large amounts of heat and gaseous products, such as combustion reactions. (The term “bomb” comes from the observation that these reactions can be vigorous enough to resemble explosions that would damage other calorimeters.) This type of calorimeter consists of a robust steel container (the “bomb”) that contains the reactants and (Figure 5.17). is itself submerged in water The sample is placed in the bomb, which is then filled with oxygen at high pressure. A small electrical spark is used to ignite the sample. The energy produced by the reaction is trapped in the steel bomb and the surrounding water. The temperature increase is measured and, along with the known heat capacity of the calorimeter, is used to calculate the energy produced by the reaction. Bomb calorimeters require calibration to determine the heat capacity of the calorimeter and ensure accurate results. The calibration is accomplished using a reaction with a known q, such as a measured quantity of benzoic acid ignited by a spark from a nickel fuse wire that is weighed before and after the reaction. The temperature change produced by the known reaction is used to determine the heat capacity of the calorimeter. The calibration is generally performed each time before the calorimeter is used to gather research data.

The bomb has a heat capacity of 784 J/°C and is submerged in 925 mL of water. How much heat was produced by the combustion of the glucose sample? Answer: 39.0 kJ Since the first one was constructed in 1899, 35 calorimeters have been built to measure the heat produced by a living person.[2] These whole-body calorimeters of various designs are large enough to hold an individual human being. More recently, whole-room calorimeters allow for relatively normal activities to be performed, and these calorimeters generate data that more closely reflect the real world. These calorimeters are used to measure the metabolism of individuals under different environmental conditions, different dietary regimes, and with different health conditions, such as diabetes. In humans, metabolism is typically measured in Calories per day. A nutritional calorie (Calorie) is the energy unit used to quantify the amount of energy derived from the metabolism of foods; one Calorie is equal to 1000 calories (1 kcal), the amount of energy needed to heat 1 kg of water by 1 °C. Chemistry in Everyday Life Measuring Nutritional Calories In your day-to-day life, you may be more familiar with energy being given in Calories, or nutritional calories, which are used to quantify the amount of energy in foods. One calorie (cal) = exactly 4.184 joules, and one Calorie (note the capitalization) = 1000 cal, or 1 kcal. (This is approximately the amount of energy needed to heat 1 kg of water by 1 °C.) The macronutrients in food are proteins, carbohydrates, and fats or oils. Proteins provide about 4 Calories per gram, carbohydrates also provide about 4 Calories per gram, and fats and oils provide about 9 Calories/ g. Nutritional labels on food packages show the caloric content of one serving of the food, as well as the breakdown into Calories from each of the three macronutrients (Figure 5.18). 2. Francis D.

(credit a: modification of work by “Rex Roof”/Flickr) For the example shown in (b), the total energy per 228-g portion is calculated by: (5 g protein × 4 Calories/g) + (31 g carb × 4 Calories/g) + (12 g fat × 9 Calories/g) = 252 Calories So, you can use food labels to count your Calories. But where do the values come from? And how accurate are they? The caloric content of foods can be determined by using bomb calorimetry; that is, by burning the food and measuring the energy it contains. A sample of food is weighed, mixed in a blender, freeze-dried, ground into powder, and formed into a pellet. The pellet is burned inside a bomb calorimeter, and the measured temperature change is converted into energy per gram of food. Today, the caloric content on food labels is derived using a method called the Atwater system that uses the average caloric content of the different chemical constituents of food, protein, carbohydrate, and fats. The average amounts are those given in the equation and are derived from the various results given by bomb calorimetry of whole foods. The carbohydrate amount is discounted a certain amount for the fiber content, which is indigestible carbohydrate. To determine the energy content of a food, the quantities of carbohydrate, protein, and fat are each multiplied by the average Calories per gram for each and the products summed to obtain the total energy.

Chapter 5 | Thermochemistry 255 5.3 Enthalpy By the end of this section, you will be able to: State the first law of thermodynamics • Define enthalpy and explain its classification as a state function • Write and balance thermochemical equations • Calculate enthalpy changes for various chemical reactions • Explain Hess’s law and use it to compute reaction enthalpies • Thermochemistry is a branch of chemical thermodynamics, the science that deals with the relationships between heat, work, and other forms of energy in the context of chemical and physical processes. As we concentrate on thermochemistry in this chapter, we need to consider some widely used concepts of thermodynamics. Substances act as reservoirs of energy, meaning that energy can be added to them or removed from them. Energy is stored in a substance when the kinetic energy of its atoms or molecules is raised. The greater kinetic energy may be in the form of increased translations (travel or straight-line motions), vibrations, or rotations of the atoms or molecules. When thermal energy is lost, the intensities of these motions decrease and the kinetic energy falls. The total of all possible kinds of energy present in a substance is called the internal energy (U), sometimes symbolized as E. As a system undergoes a change, its internal energy can change, and energy can be transferred from the system to the surroundings, or from the surroundings to the system. Energy is transferred into a system when it absorbs heat (q) from the surroundings or when the surroundings do work (w) on the system. For example, energy is transferred into room-temperature metal wire if it is immersed in hot water (the wire absorbs heat from the water), or if you rapidly bend the wire back and forth (the wire becomes warmer because of the work done on it). Both processes increase the internal energy of the wire, which is reflected in an increase in the wire’s temperature. Conversely, energy is transferred out of a system when heat is lost from the system, or when the system does work on the surroundings. The relationship between internal energy, heat, and work can be represented by the equation: ΔU = q + w Figure 5.19. as shown in This is one version of the first law of thermodynamics, and it shows that the internal energy of a system changes through heat flow into or out of the system (positive q is heat flow in; negative q is heat flow out) or work done on or by the system. The work, w, is positive if it is done on the system and negative if it is done by the system. Figure 5.19 The internal energy, U, of a system can be changed by heat flow and work. If heat flows into the system, qin, or work is done on the system, won, its internal energy increases, ΔU < 0. If heat flows out of the system, qout, or work is done by the system, wby, its internal energy decreases, ΔU > 0.

256 Chapter 5 | Thermochemistry A type of work called expansion work (or pressure-volume work) occurs when a system pushes back the surroundings against a restraining pressure, or when the surroundings compress the system. An example of this occurs during the operation of an internal combustion engine. The reaction of gasoline and oxygen is exothermic. Some of this energy is given off as heat, and some does work pushing the piston in the cylinder. The substances involved in the reaction are the system, and the engine and the rest of the universe are the surroundings. The system loses energy by both heating and doing work on the surroundings, and its internal energy decreases. (The engine is able to keep the car moving because this process is repeated many times per second while the engine is running.) We will consider how to determine the amount of work involved in a chemical or physical change in the chapter on thermodynamics. Link to Learning This view of an internal combustion engine (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/ 16combustion) illustrates the conversion of energy produced by the exothermic combustion reaction of a fuel such as gasoline into energy of motion. As discussed, the relationship between internal energy, heat, and work can be represented as ΔU = q + w. Internal energy is a type of quantity known as a state function (or state variable), whereas heat and work are not state functions. The value of a state function depends only on the state that a system is in, and not on how that state is reached. If a quantity is not a state function, then its value does depend on how the state is reached. An example of a state function is altitude or elevation. If you stand on the summit of Mt. Kilimanjaro, you are at an altitude of 5895 m, and it does not matter whether you hiked there or parachuted there. The distance you traveled to the top of Kilimanjaro, however, is not a state function. You could climb to the summit by a direct route or by a more (Figure 5.20). roundabout, circuitous path The distances traveled would differ (distance is not a state function) but the elevation reached would be the same (altitude is a state function). Figure 5.20 Paths X and Y represent two different routes to the summit of Mt. Kilimanjaro. Both have the same change in elevation (altitude or elevation on a mountain is a state function; it does not depend on path), but they have very different distances traveled (distance walked is not a state function; it depends on the path).

Chapter 5 | Thermochemistry 257 Chemists ordinarily use a property known as enthalpy (H) to describe the thermodynamics of chemical and physical processes. Enthalpy is defined as the sum of a system’s internal energy (U) and the mathematical product of its pressure (P) and volume (V): H = U + PV Since it is derived from three state functions (U, P, and V), enthalpy is also a state function. Enthalpy values for specific substances cannot be measured directly; only enthalpy changes for chemical or physical processes can be determined. For processes that take place at constant pressure (a common condition for many chemical and physical changes), the enthalpy change (ΔH) is: ΔH = ΔU + PΔV The mathematical product PΔV represents work (w), namely, expansion or pressure-volume work as noted. By their definitions, the arithmetic signs of ΔV and w will always be opposite: PΔV = −w Substituting this equation and the definition of internal energy into the enthalpy-change equation yields: ΔH = ΔU + PΔV = qp + w −w = qp where qp is the heat of reaction under conditions of constant pressure. And so, if a chemical or physical process is carried out at constant pressure with the only work done caused by expansion or contraction, then the heat flow (qp) and enthalpy change (ΔH) for the process are equal. The heat given off when you operate a Bunsen burner is equal to the enthalpy change of the methane combustion reaction that takes place, since it occurs at the essentially constant pressure of the atmosphere. On the other hand, the (Figure 5.17) heat produced by a reaction measured in a bomb calorimeter is not equal to ΔH because the closed, constant-volume metal container prevents expansion work from occurring. Chemists usually perform experiments under normal atmospheric conditions, at constant external pressure with q = ΔH, which makes enthalpy the most convenient choice for determining heat. The following conventions apply when we use ΔH: Chemists use a thermochemical equation to represent the changes in both matter and energy. In a 1. thermochemical equation, the enthalpy change of a reaction is shown as a ΔH value following the equation for the reaction. This ΔH value indicates the amount of heat associated with the reaction involving the number of moles of reactants and products as shown in the chemical equation. For example, consider this equation: 1 H2(g) + 2O2(g) ⟶H2 O(l) ΔH = −286 kJ 1 This equation indicates that when 1 mole of hydrogen gas and mole of oxygen gas at some temperature and 2 pressure change to 1 mole of liquid water at the same temperature and pressure, 286 kJ of heat are released to the surroundings. If the coefficients of the chemical equation are multiplied by some factor, the enthalpy change must be multiplied by that same factor (ΔH is an extensive property): (two-fold increase in amounts) O(l) ΔH = 2 × (−286 kJ) = −572 kJ 2H2(g) + O2(g) ⟶2H2 (two-fold amounts) decrease in 1 1 ⟶1 1 2H2(g) + 4O2(g) 2H2 O(l) ΔH = × (−286 kJ) = −143 kJ 2 The enthalpy change of a reaction depends on the physical state of the reactants and products of the reaction 2. (whether we have gases, liquids, solids, or aqueous solutions), so these must be shown. For example, when 1

258 Chapter 5 | Thermochemistry 1 mole of hydrogen gas and mole of oxygen gas change to 1 mole of liquid water at the same temperature 2 and pressure, 286 kJ of heat are released. If gaseous water forms, only 242 kJ of heat are released. 1 H2(g) + O2(g) ⟶H2 O(g) ΔH = −242 kJ 2 A negative value of an enthalpy change, ΔH, indicates an exothermic reaction; a positive value of ΔH indicates 3. an endothermic reaction. If the direction of a chemical equation is reversed, the arithmetic sign of its ΔH is changed (a process that is endothermic in one direction is exothermic in the opposite direction). Example 5.8 Measurement of an Enthalpy Change When 0.0500 mol of HCl(aq) reacts with 0.0500 mol of NaOH(aq) to form 0.0500 mol of NaCl(aq), 2.9 kJ of heat are produced.

What is the enthalpy change for the reaction when 1 mole of FeCl2(s) is produced? Answer: ΔH = −338 kJ Enthalpy changes are typically tabulated for reactions in which both the reactants and products are at the same conditions. A standard state is a commonly accepted set of conditions used as a reference point for the determination of properties under other different conditions. For chemists, the IUPAC standard state refers to materials under a pressure of 1 bar and solutions at 1 M, and does not specify a temperature. Many thermochemical tables list values with a standard state of 1 atm. Because the ΔH of a reaction changes very little with such small changes in pressure (1 bar = 0.987 atm), ΔH values (except for the most precisely measured values) are essentially the same under both sets of standard conditions. We will include a superscripted “o” in the enthalpy change symbol to designate standard state. Since the usual (but not technically standard) temperature is 298.15 K, we will use a subscripted “298” to designate (ΔH298 ° ) this temperature. Thus, the symbol is used to indicate an enthalpy change for a process occurring under these conditions. (The symbol ΔH is used to indicate an enthalpy change for a reaction occurring under nonstandard conditions.) The enthalpy changes for many types of chemical and physical processes are available in the reference literature, including those for combustion reactions, phase transitions, and formation reactions. As we discuss these quantities, it is important to pay attention to the extensive nature of enthalpy and enthalpy changes. Since the enthalpy change for a given reaction is proportional to the amounts of substances involved, it may be reported on that basis (i.e., as the ΔH for specific amounts of reactants). However, we often find it more useful to divide one extensive property (ΔH) by another (amount of substance), and report a per-amount intensive value of ΔH, often “normalized” to a per-mole basis. (Note that this is similar to determining the intensive property specific heat from the extensive property heat capacity, as seen previously.) Enthalpy of Combustion ° (ΔHC ) Standard enthalpy of combustion is the enthalpy change when 1 mole of a substance burns (combines vigorously with oxygen) under standard state conditions; it is sometimes called “heat of combustion.” For example, the enthalpy of combustion of ethanol, −1366.8 kJ/mol, is the amount of heat produced when one mole of ethanol undergoes complete combustion at 25 °C and 1 atmosphere pressure, yielding products also at 25 °C and 1 atm. C2 H5 OH(l) + 3O2(g) ⟶2CO2 + 3H2 O(l) ΔH298 ° = −1366.8 kJ

Among the most promising biofuels are those derived from algae (Figure 5.22). The species of algae used are nontoxic, biodegradable, and among the world’s fastest growing organisms. About 50% of algal weight is oil, which can be readily converted into fuel such as biodiesel. Algae can yield 26,000 gallons of biofuel per hectare—much more energy per acre than other crops. Some strains of algae can

The cost of algal fuels is becoming more competitive—for instance, the US Air gallon.[3] Force is producing jet fuel from algae at a total cost of under $5 per The process used to produce algal fuel is as follows: grow the algae (which use sunlight as their energy source and CO2 as a raw material); harvest the algae; extract the fuel compounds (or precursor compounds); process as necessary (e.g., perform a transesterification reaction to make biodiesel); purify; and distribute (Figure 5.23).

Standard Enthalpy of Formation A standard enthalpy of formation is an enthalpy change for a reaction in which exactly 1 mole of a pure substance is formed from free elements in their most stable states under standard state conditions. These values are especially useful for computing or predicting enthalpy changes for chemical reactions that are impractical or dangerous to carry out, or for processes for which it is difficult to make measurements. If we have values for the appropriate standard enthalpies of formation, we can determine the enthalpy change for any reaction, which we will practice in the next section on Hess’s law. The standard enthalpy of formation of CO2(g) is −393.5 kJ/mol. This is the enthalpy change for the exothermic reaction: C(s) + O2(g) ⟶CO2(g) ΔHf° = ΔH298 ° = −393.5 kJ starting with the reactants at a pressure of 1 atm and 25 °C (with the carbon present as graphite, the most stable form of carbon under these conditions) and ending with one mole of CO2, also at 1 atm and 25 °C. For nitrogen dioxide, ΔHf° NO2(g), is 33.2 kJ/mol. This is the enthalpy change for the reaction: 1 2N2(g) + O2(g) ⟶NO2(g) ΔHf° = ΔH298 ° = +33.2 kJ 1 A reaction equation with mole of N2 and 1 mole of O2 is correct in this case because the standard enthalpy of 2 formation always refers to 1 mole of product, NO2(g). Appendix G. You will find a table of standard enthalpies of formation of many common substances in These values indicate that formation reactions range from highly exothermic (such as −2984 kJ/mol for the formation of P4O10) to strongly endothermic (such as +226.7 kJ/mol for the formation of acetylene, C2H2). By definition, the standard enthalpy of formation of an element in its most stable form is equal to zero under standard conditions, which is 1 atm for gases and 1 M for solutions. Example 5.11 Evaluating an Enthalpy of Formation Ozone, O3(g), forms from oxygen, O2(g), by an endothermic process. Ultraviolet radiation is the source of the energy that drives this reaction in the upper atmosphere. Assuming that both the reactants and products ΔHf° of the reaction are in their standard states, determine the standard enthalpy of formation, of ozone from the following information: 3O2(g) ⟶2O3(g) ΔH298 ° = +286 kJ Solution ΔHf° is the enthalpy change for the formation of one mole of a substance in its standard state from the ΔHf° elements in their standard states.

Chapter 5 | Thermochemistry 265 Hess’s Law There are two ways to determine the amount of heat involved in a chemical change: measure it experimentally, or calculate it from other experimentally determined enthalpy changes. Some reactions are difficult, if not impossible, to investigate and make accurate measurements for experimentally. And even when a reaction is not hard to perform or measure, it is convenient to be able to determine the heat involved in a reaction without having to perform an experiment. This type of calculation usually involves the use of Hess’s law, which states: If a process can be written as the sum of several stepwise processes, the enthalpy change of the total process equals the sum of the enthalpy changes of the various steps. Hess’s law is valid because enthalpy is a state function: Enthalpy changes depend only on where a chemical process starts and ends, but not on the path it takes from start to finish. For example, we can think of the reaction of carbon with oxygen to form carbon dioxide as occurring either directly or by a two-step process. The direct process is written: C(s) + O2(g) ⟶CO2(g) ΔH298 ° = −394 kJ In the two-step process, first carbon monoxide is formed: 1 kJ C(s) + 2O2(g) ⟶CO(g) ΔH298 ° = −111 Then, carbon monoxide reacts further to form carbon dioxide: 1 CO(g) + 2O2(g) ⟶CO(g) ΔH298 ° = −283 kJ The equation describing the overall reaction is the sum of these two chemical changes: 1 Step 1: C(s) + 2O2(g) ⟶CO(g) 1 CO(g) + Step 2: 2O2(g) ⟶CO2(g) 1 1 Sum: C(s) + 2O2(g) + CO(g) + 2O2(g) ⟶CO(g) + CO2(g) Because the CO produced in Step 1 is consumed in Step 2, the net change is: C(s) + O2(g) ⟶CO2(g) According to Hess’s law, the enthalpy change of the reaction will equal the sum of the enthalpy changes of the steps. Table 5.2 We can apply the data from the experimental enthalpies of combustion in to find the enthalpy change of the entire reaction from its two steps: 1 C(s) + 2O2(g) ⟶CO(g) ΔH298 ° = −111 kJ 1 2O2(g) ⟶CO2(g) CO(g) + ΔH298 ° = −283 kJ C(s) + O2(g) ⟶CO2(g) ΔH298 ° = −394 kJ Figure 5.24. The result is shown in We see that ΔH of the overall reaction is the same whether it occurs in one step or two. This finding (overall ΔH for the reaction = sum of ΔH values for reaction “steps” in the overall reaction) is true in general for chemical and physical processes. 

--- Page 274 ---
266 Chapter 5 | Thermochemistry Figure 5.24 The formation of CO2(g) from its elements can be thought of as occurring in two steps, which sum to the overall reaction, as described by Hess’s law. The horizontal blue lines represent enthalpies. For an exothermic process, the products are at lower enthalpy than are the reactants. Before we further practice using Hess’s law, let us recall two important features of ΔH. ΔH is directly proportional to the quantities of reactants or products. For example, the enthalpy change for the 1. reaction forming 1 mole of NO2(g) is +33.2 kJ: 1 2N2(g) + O2(g) ⟶NO2(g) ΔH = +33.2 kJ When 2 moles of NO2 (twice as much) are formed, the ΔH will be twice as large: N2(g) + 2O2(g) ⟶2NO2(g) ΔH = +66.4 kJ In general, if we multiply or divide an equation by a number, then the enthalpy change should also be multiplied or divided by the same number. ΔH for a reaction in one direction is equal in magnitude and opposite in sign to ΔH for the reaction in the 2. reverse direction. For example, given that: H2(g) + Cl2(g) ⟶2HCl(g) ΔH = −184.6 kJ Then, for the “reverse” reaction, the enthalpy change is also “reversed”: 2HCl(g) ⟶H2(g) + Cl2(g) ΔH = +184.6 kJ Example 5.13 Stepwise Calculation of Using Hess’s Law ΔHf° ΔHf° , Determine the enthalpy of formation, of FeCl3(s) from the enthalpy changes of the following two- step process that occurs under standard state conditions: Fe(s) + Cl2(g) ⟶FeCl2(s) ΔH° = −341.8 kJ 1 kJ FeCl2(s) + 2Cl2(g) ⟶FeCl3(s) ΔH° = −57.7 Solution https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

Looking at the reactions, we see that the reaction for which we want to find ΔH° is the sum of the two reactions with known ΔH values, so we must sum their ΔHs: −341.8 kJ Fe(s) + Cl2(g) ⟶FeCl2(s) ΔH° = 1 FeCl2(s) + 2Cl2(g) ⟶FeCl3(s) ΔH° = −57.7 kJ ΔH° = −399.5 kJ 1 + Fe(s) 2Cl2(g) ⟶FeCl3(s) ΔHf° , The enthalpy of formation, of FeCl3(s) is −399.5 kJ/mol.

It shows how we can find many standard enthalpies of formation (and other values of ΔH) if they are difficult to determine experimentally. Example 5.14 A More Challenging Problem Using Hess’s Law Chlorine monofluoride can react with fluorine to form chlorine trifluoride: ClF(g) + F2(g) ⟶ClF3(g) ΔH° = ? (i) Use the reactions here to determine the ΔH° for reaction (i): 2OF2(g) ⟶O2(g) + 2F2(g) ΔH(ii) ° = −49.4 kJ (ii) 2ClF(g) + O2(g) ⟶Cl2 O(g) + OF2(g) ΔH(iii) ° = +205.6 kJ (iii) 3 ClF3(g) + O2(g) ⟶Cl2 O(g) 2OF2(g) ΔH(iv) ° = + +266.7 kJ (iv) Solution Our goal is to manipulate and combine reactions (ii), (iii), and (iv) such that they add up to reaction (i).

268 Chapter 5 | Thermochemistry Next, we see that F2 is also needed as a reactant. To get this, reverse and halve reaction (ii), which means that the ΔH° changes sign and is halved: 1 2O2(g) + F2(g) ⟶OF2(g) ΔH° = +24.7 kJ To get ClF3 as a product, reverse (iv), changing the sign of ΔH°: 3 1 2Cl2 O(g) + 2OF2(g) ⟶ClF3(g) + O2(g) ΔH° = +266.7 kJ Now check to make sure that these reactions add up to the reaction we want: 1 ⟶1 1 ClF(g) + 2O2(g) 2Cl2 O(g) + 2OF2(g) ΔH° = +102.8 kJ 1 2O2(g) + F2(g) ⟶OF2(g) ΔH° = +24.7 kJ 3 1 2Cl2 O(g) + 2OF2(g) ⟶ClF3(g) + O2(g) ΔH° = −266.7 kJ ClF(g) + ΔH° = −139.2 kJ F2 ⟶ClF3(g) 1 1 1 1 2O2 2O2 2Cl2 O 2Cl2 O; Reactants and cancel out product O2; product cancels reactant and reactant 3 1 2OF2 2OF2 is cancelled by products and OF2.

The stepwise reactions we consider are: (i) decompositions of the reactants into their component elements (for which the enthalpy changes are proportional to the negative of the enthalpies of formation of the reactants), followed by (ii) re-combinations of the elements to give the products (with the enthalpy changes proportional to the enthalpies of formation of the products). The standard enthalpy change of the overall reaction is therefore equal to: (ii) the sum of the standard enthalpies of formation of all the products plus (i) the sum of the negatives of the standard enthalpies of formation of the reactants.

Chapter 5 | Thermochemistry 269 The following example shows in detail why this equation is valid, and how to use it to calculate the enthalpy change for a reaction of interest. Example 5.15 Using Hess’s Law What is the standard enthalpy change for the reaction: 3NO2(g) O(l) ⟶2HNO3(aq) + NO(g) ΔH° = ? + H2 Solution 1 (Supporting Why the General Equation Is Valid) We can write this reaction as the sum of the decompositions of 3NO2(g) and 1H2O(l) into their constituent elements, and the formation of 2HNO3(aq) and 1NO(g) from their constituent elements. Writing out these ΔHf° Appendix G reactions, and noting their relationships to the values for these compounds (from ), we have: kJ 3NO2(g) ⟶N2(g) + O2(g) ΔH1° = 99.6 1 H2 O(l) ⟶H2(g) + 2O2(g) ΔH2° = +285.8 kJ [−1 × ΔHf° (H2 O)] H2(g) + N2(g) + O2(g) ⟶2HNO3(aq) ΔH3° = 414.8 kJ [2 × ΔHf° (HNO3)] 1 1 2N2(g) + 2O2(g) ⟶NO(g) ΔH4° = +90.2 kJ [1 × (NO)] Summing these reaction equations gives the reaction we are interested in: 3NO2(g) + H2 O(l) ⟶2HNO3(aq) + NO(g) Summing their enthalpy changes gives the value we want to determine: ΔHrxn ° = ΔH1° + ΔH2° + ΔH3° + ΔH4° = (−99.6 kJ) + (+285.8 kJ) + (−414.8 kJ) + (+90.2 kJ) = −138.4 kJ So the standard enthalpy change for this reaction is ΔH° = −138.4 kJ. ΔHf° Note that this result was obtained by (1) multiplying the of each product by its stoichiometric ΔHf° of each reactant by its stoichiometric coefficient and summing those values, (2) multiplying the coefficient and summing those values, and then (3) subtracting the result found in (2) from the result found in (1). This is also the procedure in using the general equation, as shown.

Kinetic energy (KE) is the energy of motion; potential energy is energy due to relative position, composition, or condition. When energy is converted from one form into another, energy is neither created nor destroyed (law of conservation of energy or first law of thermodynamics). Matter has thermal energy due to the KE of its molecules and temperature that corresponds to the average KE of its molecules. Heat is energy that is transferred between objects at different temperatures; it flows from a high to a low temperature. Chemical and physical processes can absorb heat (endothermic) or release heat (exothermic). The SI unit of energy, heat, and work is the joule (J). Specific heat and heat capacity are measures of the energy needed to change the temperature of a substance or object. The amount of heat absorbed or released by a substance depends directly on the type of substance, its mass, and the temperature change it undergoes. 5.2 Calorimetry Calorimetry is used to measure the amount of thermal energy transferred in a chemical or physical process. This requires careful measurement of the temperature change that occurs during the process and the masses of the system https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

Chapter 5 | Thermochemistry 273 and surroundings. These measured quantities are then used to compute the amount of heat produced or consumed in the process using known mathematical relations. Calorimeters are designed to minimize energy exchange between the system being studied and its surroundings. They range from simple coffee cup calorimeters used by introductory chemistry students to sophisticated bomb calorimeters used to determine the energy content of food. 5.3 Enthalpy If a chemical change is carried out at constant pressure and the only work done is caused by expansion or contraction, ΔH298 ° q for the change is called the enthalpy change with the symbol ΔH, or for reactions occurring under standard state conditions. The value of ΔH for a reaction in one direction is equal in magnitude, but opposite in sign, to ΔH for the reaction in the opposite direction, and ΔH is directly proportional to the quantity of reactants and products. Examples of enthalpy changes include enthalpy of combustion, enthalpy of fusion, enthalpy of vaporization, and ΔHf° , standard enthalpy of formation. The standard enthalpy of formation, is the enthalpy change accompanying the formation of 1 mole of a substance from the elements in their most stable states at 1 bar (standard state). Many of the processes are carried out at 298.15 K. If the enthalpies of formation are available for the reactants and products of a reaction, the enthalpy change can be calculated using Hess’s law: If a process can be written as the sum of several stepwise processes, the enthalpy change of the total process equals the sum of the enthalpy changes of the various steps.

The sudden appearance was due to a supernova explosion, which was much brighter than the original star. Even though this supernova was observed almost a millennium ago, the (Figure 6.1) remaining Crab Nebula continues to release energy today. It emits not only visible light but also infrared light, X-rays, and other forms of electromagnetic radiation. The nebula emits both continuous spectra (the blue-white glow) and atomic emission spectra (the colored filaments). In this chapter, we will discuss light and other forms of electromagnetic radiation and how they are related to the electronic structure of atoms. We will also see how this radiation can be used to identify elements, even from thousands of light years away.

282 Chapter 6 | Electronic Structure and Periodic Properties of Elements 6.1 Electromagnetic Energy By the end of this section, you will be able to: Explain the basic behavior of waves, including travelling waves and standing waves • Describe the wave nature of light • Use appropriate equations to calculate related light-wave properties such as period, frequency, • wavelength, and energy Distinguish between line and continuous emission spectra • Describe the particle nature of light • The nature of light has been a subject of inquiry since antiquity. In the seventeenth century, Isaac Newton performed experiments with lenses and prisms and was able to demonstrate that white light consists of the individual colors of the rainbow combined together. Newton explained his optics findings in terms of a "corpuscular" view of light, in which light was composed of streams of extremely tiny particles travelling at high speeds according to Newton's laws of motion. Others in the seventeenth century, such as Christiaan Huygens, had shown that optical phenomena such as reflection and refraction could be equally well explained in terms of light as waves travelling at high speed through a medium called "luminiferous aether" that was thought to permeate all space. Early in the nineteenth century, Thomas Young demonstrated that light passing through narrow, closely spaced slits produced interference patterns that could not be explained in terms of Newtonian particles but could be easily explained in terms of waves. Later in the nineteenth century, after James Clerk Maxwell developed his theory of electromagnetic radiation and showed that light was the visible part of a vast spectrum of electromagnetic waves, the particle view of light became thoroughly discredited. By the end of the nineteenth century, scientists viewed the physical universe as roughly comprising two separate domains: matter composed of particles moving according to Newton's laws of motion, and electromagnetic radiation consisting of waves governed by Maxwell's equations. Today, these domains are referred to as classical mechanics and classical electrodynamics (or classical electromagnetism). Although there were a few physical phenomena that could not be explained within this framework, scientists at that time were so confident of the overall soundness of this framework that they viewed these aberrations as puzzling paradoxes that would ultimately be resolved somehow within this framework. As we shall see, these paradoxes led to a contemporary framework that intimately connects particles and waves at a fundamental level called wave-particle duality, which has superseded the classical view. Visible light and other forms of electromagnetic radiation play important roles in chemistry, since they can be used to infer the energies of electrons within atoms and molecules. Much of modern technology is based on electromagnetic radiation. For example, radio waves from a mobile phone, X-rays used by dentists, the energy used to cook food in your microwave, the radiant heat from red-hot objects, and the light from your television screen are forms of electromagnetic radiation that all exhibit wavelike behavior. Waves A wave is an oscillation or periodic movement that can transport energy from one point in space to another. Common examples of waves are all around us. Shaking the end of a rope transfers energy from your hand to the other end of the rope, dropping a pebble into a pond causes waves to ripple outward along the water's surface, and the expansion of air that accompanies a lightning strike generates sound waves (thunder) that can travel outward for several miles. In each of these cases, kinetic energy is transferred through matter (the rope, water, or air) while the matter remains essentially in place. An insightful example of a wave occurs in sports stadiums when fans in a narrow region of seats rise simultaneously and stand with their arms raised up for a few seconds before sitting down again while the fans in neighboring sections likewise stand up and sit down in sequence. While this wave can quickly encircle a large stadium in a few seconds, none of the fans actually travel with the wave-they all stay in or above their seats. https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

Chapter 6 | Electronic Structure and Periodic Properties of Elements 283 Waves need not be restricted to travel through matter. As Maxwell showed, electromagnetic waves consist of an electric field oscillating in step with a perpendicular magnetic field, both of which are perpendicular to the direction of 108 × travel. These waves can travel through a vacuum at a constant speed of 2.998 m/s, the speed of light (denoted by c). All waves, including forms of electromagnetic radiation, are characterized by, a wavelength (denoted by λ, the lowercase Greek letter lambda), a frequency (denoted by ν, the lowercase Greek letter nu), and an amplitude. As can Figure 6.2, be seen in the wavelength is the distance between two consecutive peaks or troughs in a wave (measured in meters in the SI system). Electromagnetic waves have wavelengths that fall within an enormous range-wavelengths (103 (10−12 of kilometers m) to picometers m) have been observed. The frequency is the number of wave cycles that pass a specified point in space in a specified amount of time (in the SI system, this is measured in seconds). A cycle [s−1], corresponds to one complete wavelength. The unit for frequency, expressed as cycles per second is the hertz 106 109 × × Hz) and gigahertz (1 GHz = 1 Hz). (Hz). Common multiples of this unit are megahertz, (1 MHz = 1 Figure 6.2, The amplitude corresponds to the magnitude of the wave's displacement and so, in this corresponds to one-half the height between the peaks and troughs. The amplitude is related to the intensity of the wave, which for light is the brightness, and for sound is the loudness. Figure 6.2 One-dimensional sinusoidal waves show the relationship among wavelength, frequency, and speed. The wave with the shortest wavelength has the highest frequency. Amplitude is one-half the height of the wave from peak to trough. The product of a wave's wavelength (λ) and its frequency (ν), λν, is the speed of the wave. Thus, for electromagnetic radiation in a vacuum: 108 ms−1 c = 2.998 × = λν Wavelength and frequency are inversely proportional: As the wavelength increases, the frequency decreases. The Figure 6.3. inverse proportionality is illustrated in This figure also shows the electromagnetic spectrum, the range of all types of electromagnetic radiation. Each of the various colors of visible light has specific frequencies and wavelengths associated with them, and you can see that visible light makes up only a small portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. Because the technologies developed to work in various parts of the electromagnetic spectrum are different, for reasons of convenience and historical legacies, different units are typically used for

Stevens) Many valuable technologies operate in the radio (3 kHz-300 GHz) frequency region of the electromagnetic spectrum. At the low frequency (low energy, long wavelength) end of this region are AM (amplitude modulation) radio signals (540-2830 kHz) that can travel long distances. FM (frequency modulation) radio signals are used at higher frequencies (87.5-108.0 MHz). In AM radio, the information is transmitted by varying the amplitude

Figure 6.5 This schematic depicts how amplitude modulation (AM) and frequency modulation (FM) can be used to transmit a radio wave. Other technologies also operate in the radio-wave portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. For example, 4G cellular telephone signals are approximately 880 MHz, while Global Positioning System (GPS) signals operate at 1.228 and 1.575 GHz, local area wireless technology (Wi-Fi) networks operate at 2.4 to 5 GHz, and highway toll sensors operate at 5.8 GHz. The frequencies associated with these applications are convenient because such waves tend not to be absorbed much by common building materials. One particularly characteristic phenomenon of waves results when two or more waves come into contact: They Figure 6.6 interfere with each other. shows the interference patterns that arise when light passes through narrow slits closely spaced about a wavelength apart. The fringe patterns produced depend on the wavelength, with the fringes being more closely spaced for shorter wavelength light passing through a given set of slits. When the light passes through the two slits, each slit effectively acts as a new source, resulting in two closely spaced waves coming Figure 6.6 into contact at the detector (the camera in this case). The dark regions in correspond to regions where the peaks for the wave from one slit happen to coincide with the troughs for the wave from the other slit (destructive interference), while the brightest regions correspond to the regions where the peaks for the two waves (or their two troughs) happen to coincide (constructive interference). Likewise, when two stones are tossed close together into a pond, interference patterns are visible in the interactions between the waves produced by the stones. Such interference patterns cannot be explained by particles moving according to the laws of classical mechanics. https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

(credit: PASCO) Portrait of a Chemist Dorothy Hodgkin Because the wavelengths of X-rays (10-10,000 picometers [pm]) are comparable to the size of atoms, X-rays can be used to determine the structure of molecules. When a beam of X-rays is passed through molecules packed together in a crystal, the X-rays collide with the electrons and scatter. Constructive and destructive interference of these scattered X-rays creates a specific diffraction pattern. Calculating backward from this pattern, the positions of each of the atoms in the molecule can be determined very precisely. One of the pioneers who helped create this technology was Dorothy Crowfoot Hodgkin. She was born in Cairo, Egypt, in 1910, where her British parents were studying archeology. Even as a young girl, she was fascinated with minerals and crystals. When she was a student at Oxford University, she began researching how X-ray crystallography could be used to determine the structure of biomolecules. She invented new techniques that allowed her and her students to determine the structures of vitamin B12, penicillin, and many other important molecules. Diabetes, a disease that affects 382 million people worldwide, involves the hormone insulin. Hodgkin began studying the structure of insulin in 1934, but it required several decades of advances in the field before she finally reported the structure in 1969. Understanding the structure has led to better understanding of the disease and treatment options. Not all waves are travelling waves. Standing waves (also known as stationary waves) remain constrained within some region of space. As we shall see, standing waves play an important role in our understanding of the electronic structure of atoms and molecules. The simplest example of a standing wave is a one-dimensional wave associated Figure 6.7 with a vibrating string that is held fixed at its two end points. shows the four lowest-energy standing waves (the fundamental wave and the lowest three harmonics) for a vibrating string at a particular amplitude. Although the string's motion lies mostly within a plane, the wave itself is considered to be one dimensional, since it lies along the length of the string. The motion of string segments in a direction perpendicular to the string length generates the waves and so the amplitude of the waves is visible as the maximum displacement of the curves seen Figure 6.7. in The key observation from the figure is that only those waves having an integer number, n, of half- wavelengths between the end points can form. A system with fixed end points such as this restricts the number and type of the possible waveforms. This is an example of quantization, in which only discrete values from a more general set of continuous values of some property are observed. Another important observation is that the harmonic waves (those waves displaying more than one-half wavelength) all have one or more points between the two end points that are not in motion. These special points are nodes. The energies of the standing waves with a given amplitude in a vibrating string increase with the number of half-wavelengths n. Since the number of nodes is n – 1, the energy can also be said to depend on the number of nodes, generally increasing as the number of nodes increases.

288 Chapter 6 | Electronic Structure and Periodic Properties of Elements Figure 6.7 A vibrating string shows some one-dimensional standing waves. Since the two end points of the string are held fixed, only waves having an integer number of half-wavelengths can form. The points on the string between the end points that are not moving are called the nodes. Figure 6.8, An example of two-dimensional standing waves is shown in which shows the vibrational patterns on a flat surface. Although the vibrational amplitudes cannot be seen like they could in the vibrating string, the nodes have been made visible by sprinkling the drum surface with a powder that collects on the areas of the surface that have minimal displacement. For one-dimensional standing waves, the nodes were points on the line, but for two- dimensional standing waves, the nodes are lines on the surface (for three-dimensional standing waves, the nodes are two-dimensional surfaces within the three-dimensional volume). Because of the circular symmetry of the drum surface, its boundary conditions (the drum surface being tightly constrained to the circumference of the drum) result in two types of nodes: radial nodes that sweep out all angles at constant radii and, thus, are seen as circles about the center, and angular nodes that sweep out all radii at constant angles and, thus, are seen as lines passing through the Figure 6.8 center.

Blackbody Radiation and the Ultraviolet Catastrophe The last few decades of the nineteenth century witnessed intense research activity in commercializing newly discovered electric lighting. This required obtaining a better understanding of the distributions of light emitted from various sources being considered. Artificial lighting is usually designed to mimic natural sunlight within the limitations of the underlying technology. Such lighting consists of a range of broadly distributed frequencies that form Figure 6.9 a continuous spectrum. shows the wavelength distribution for sunlight. The most intense radiation is in the visible region, with the intensity dropping off rapidly for shorter wavelength ultraviolet (UV) light, and more slowly for longer wavelength infrared (IR) light.

290 Chapter 6 | Electronic Structure and Periodic Properties of Elements Figure 6.9 The spectral distribution (light intensity vs. wavelength) of sunlight reaches the Earth's atmosphere as UV light, visible light, and IR light. The unabsorbed sunlight at the top of the atmosphere has a distribution that approximately matches the theoretical distribution of a blackbody at 5250 °C, represented by the blue curve. (credit: modification of work by American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) Terrestrial Reference Spectra for Photovoltaic Performance Evaluation) Figure 6.9, In the solar distribution is compared to a representative distribution, called a blackbody spectrum, that corresponds to a temperature of 5250 °C. The blackbody spectrum matches the solar spectrum quite well. A blackbody is a convenient, ideal emitter that approximates the behavior of many materials when heated. It is “ideal” in the same sense that an ideal gas is a convenient, simple representation of real gases that works well, provided that the pressure is not too high nor the temperature too low. A good approximation of a blackbody that can be used to observe blackbody radiation is a metal oven that can be heated to very high temperatures. The oven has a small hole allowing for the light being emitted within the oven to be observed with a spectrometer so that the wavelengths Figure 6.10 and their intensities can be measured. shows the resulting curves for some representative temperatures. Each distribution depends only on a single parameter: the temperature. The maxima in the blackbody curves, λmax, shift to shorter wavelengths as the temperature increases, reflecting the observation that metals being heated to high temperatures begin to glow a darker red that becomes brighter as the temperature increases, eventually becoming white hot at very high temperatures as the intensities of all of the visible wavelengths become appreciable. This common observation was at the heart of the first paradox that showed the fundamental limitations of classical physics that we will examine. Physicists derived mathematical expressions for the blackbody curves using well-accepted concepts from the theories of classical mechanics and classical electromagnetism. The theoretical expressions as functions of temperature fit the observed experimental blackbody curves well at longer wavelengths, but showed significant discrepancies at shorter wavelengths. Not only did the theoretical curves not show a peak, they absurdly showed the intensity becoming infinitely large as the wavelength became smaller, which would imply that everyday objects at room temperature should be emitting large amounts of UV light. This became known as the “ultraviolet catastrophe” because no one https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

Chapter 6 | Electronic Structure and Periodic Properties of Elements 291 could find any problems with the theoretical treatment that could lead to such unrealistic short-wavelength behavior. Finally, around 1900, Max Planck derived a theoretical expression for blackbody radiation that fit the experimental observations exactly (within experimental error). Planck developed his theoretical treatment by extending the earlier work that had been based on the premise that the atoms composing the oven vibrated at increasing frequencies (or decreasing wavelengths) as the temperature increased, with these vibrations being the source of the emitted electromagnetic radiation. But where the earlier treatments had allowed the vibrating atoms to have any energy values obtained from a continuous set of energies (perfectly reasonable, according to classical physics), Planck found that by restricting the vibrational energies to discrete values for each frequency, he could derive an expression for blackbody radiation that correctly had the intensity dropping rapidly for the short wavelengths in the UV region. E = nhν, n = 1, 2, 3, . . . The quantity h is a constant now known as Planck's constant, in his honor. Although Planck was pleased he had resolved the blackbody radiation paradox, he was disturbed that to do so, he needed to assume the vibrating atoms required quantized energies, which he was unable to explain. The value of Planck's constant is very small, 6.626 10−34 × joule seconds (J s), which helps explain why energy quantization had not been observed previously in macroscopic phenomena. Figure 6.10 Blackbody spectral distribution curves are shown for some representative temperatures. The Photoelectric Effect (Figure 6.11). The next paradox in the classical theory to be resolved concerned the photoelectric effect It had been observed that electrons could be ejected from the clean surface of a metal when light having a frequency greater than some threshold frequency was shone on it. Surprisingly, the kinetic energy of the ejected electrons did not depend on the brightness of the light, but increased with increasing frequency of the light. Since the electrons in the metal had a certain amount of binding energy keeping them there, the incident light needed to have more energy to free the electrons. According to classical wave theory, a wave's energy depends on its intensity (which depends on its amplitude), not its frequency. One part of these observations was that the number of electrons ejected within in a 

--- Page 300 ---
292 Chapter 6 | Electronic Structure and Periodic Properties of Elements given time period was seen to increase as the brightness increased. In 1905, Albert Einstein was able to resolve the paradox by incorporating Planck's quantization findings into the discredited particle view of light (Einstein actually won his Nobel prize for this work, and not for his theories of relativity for which he is most famous). Einstein argued that the quantized energies that Planck had postulated in his treatment of blackbody radiation could be applied to the light in the photoelectric effect so that the light striking the metal surface should not be viewed as a wave, but instead as a stream of particles (later called photons) whose energy depended on their frequency, according hc E = to Planck's formula, E = hν (or, in terms of wavelength using c = νλ, ). Electrons were ejected when hit λ by photons having sufficient energy (a frequency greater than the threshold). The greater the frequency, the greater the kinetic energy imparted to the escaping electrons by the collisions. Einstein also argued that the light intensity did not depend on the amplitude of the incoming wave, but instead corresponded to the number of photons striking the surface within a given time period. This explains why the number of ejected electrons increased with increasing brightness, since the greater the number of incoming photons, the greater the likelihood that they would collide with some of the electrons. With Einstein's findings, the nature of light took on a new air of mystery. Although many light phenomena could be explained either in terms of waves or particles, certain phenomena, such as the interference patterns obtained when light passed through a double slit, were completely contrary to a particle view of light, while other phenomena, such as the photoelectric effect, were completely contrary to a wave view of light. Somehow, at a deep fundamental level still not fully understood, light is both wavelike and particle-like. This is known as wave-particle duality. Figure 6.11 Photons with low frequencies do not have enough energy to cause electrons to be ejected via the photoelectric effect. For any frequency of light above the threshold frequency, the kinetic energy of ejected electron will be proportional to the energy of the incoming photon. Example 6.2 Calculating the Energy of Radiation When we see light from a neon sign, we are observing radiation from excited neon atoms. If this radiation has a wavelength of 640 nm, what is the energy of the photon being emitted?

(b) Increasing the wavelength of incoming light increases the kinetic energy of the ejected electrons. (c) Increasing the brightness of incoming light increases the number of ejected electrons. (d) Increasing the frequency of incoming light can increase the number of ejected electrons. Solution (a) False. Increasing the brightness of incoming light has no effect on the kinetic energy of the ejected electrons. Only energy, not the number or amplitude, of the photons influences the kinetic energy of the electrons. (b) False. Increasing the frequency of incoming light increases the kinetic energy of the ejected electrons. Frequency is proportional to energy and inversely proportional to wavelength. Frequencies above the threshold value transfer the excess energy into the kinetic energy of the electrons. (c) True.

When solids, liquids, or condensed gases are heated sufficiently, they radiate some of the excess energy as light. Photons produced in this manner have a range of energies, and thereby produce a continuous spectrum in which an unbroken series of wavelengths is present. Most of the light generated from stars (including our sun) is produced in this fashion. You can see all the visible wavelengths of light Figure 6.9, present in sunlight by using a prism to separate them. As can be seen in sunlight also contains UV light (shorter wavelengths) and IR light (longer wavelengths) that can be detected using instruments but that are invisible to the human eye. Incandescent (glowing) solids such as tungsten filaments in incandescent lights also give off light that contains all wavelengths of visible light. These continuous spectra can often be approximated by blackbody radiation Figure 6.10. curves at some appropriate temperature, such as those shown in In contrast to continuous spectra, light can also occur as discrete or line spectra having very narrow line widths Figure 6.13. interspersed throughout the spectral regions such as those shown in Exciting a gas at low partial pressure using an electrical current, or heating it, will produce line spectra.

(credit: Dave Shaver) Each emission line consists of a single wavelength of light, which implies that the light emitted by a gas consists of a set of discrete energies. For example, when an electric discharge passes through a tube containing hydrogen gas at low pressure, the H2 molecules are broken apart into separate H atoms, we see a blue-pink color.

Chapter 6 | Electronic Structure and Periodic Properties of Elements 295 Figure 6.13 Compare the two types of emission spectra: continuous spectrum of white light (top) and the line spectra of the light from excited sodium, hydrogen, calcium, and mercury atoms. The origin of discrete spectra in atoms and molecules was extremely puzzling to scientists in the late nineteenth century, since according to classical electromagnetic theory, only continuous spectra should be observed. Even more puzzling, in 1885, Johann Balmer was able to derive an empirical equation that related the four visible wavelengths of light emitted by hydrogen atoms to whole integers. That equation is the following one, in which k is a constant: ⎞ k⎛ 1 −1 1 ⎠, ⎝ = n = 3, 4, 5, 6 4 λ n2 Other discrete lines for the hydrogen atom were found in the UV and IR regions. Johannes Rydberg generalized Balmer's work and developed an empirical formula that predicted all of hydrogen's emission lines, not just those 107 R∞is × restricted to the visible range, where, n1 and n2 are integers, n1 < n2, and the Rydberg constant (1.097 m−1). ⎛ ⎞ ⎜1 ⎟ 1 −1 = R∞ ⎝ ⎠ λ 2 2 n1 n2 Even in the late nineteenth century, spectroscopy was a very precise science, and so the wavelengths of hydrogen were measured to very high accuracy, which implied that the Rydberg constant could be determined very precisely as well. That such a simple formula as the Rydberg formula could account for such precise measurements seemed astounding at the time, but it was the eventual explanation for emission spectra by Neils Bohr in 1913 that ultimately convinced scientists to abandon classical physics and spurred the development of modern quantum mechanics.

296 Chapter 6 | Electronic Structure and Periodic Properties of Elements 6.2 The Bohr Model By the end of this section, you will be able to: Describe the Bohr model of the hydrogen atom • Use the Rydberg equation to calculate energies of light emitted or absorbed by hydrogen atoms • Following the work of Ernest Rutherford and his colleagues in the early twentieth century, the picture of atoms consisting of tiny dense nuclei surrounded by lighter and even tinier electrons continually moving about the nucleus was well established. This picture was called the planetary model, since it pictured the atom as a miniature “solar system” with the electrons orbiting the nucleus like planets orbiting the sun. The simplest atom is hydrogen, consisting of a single proton as the nucleus about which a single electron moves. The electrostatic force attracting the electron to the proton depends only on the distance between the two particles. The electrostatic force has the same form as the gravitational force between two mass particles except that the electrostatic force depends on the magnitudes of the charges on the particles (+1 for the proton and −1 for the electron) instead of the magnitudes of the particle masses that govern the gravitational force. Since forces can be derived from potentials, it is convenient to work with potentials instead, since they are forms of energy. The electrostatic potential is also called the Coulomb potential. Because the electrostatic potential has the same form as the gravitational potential, according to classical mechanics, the equations of motion should be similar, with the electron moving around the nucleus in circular or elliptical orbits (hence the label “planetary” model of the atom). Potentials of the form V(r) that depend only on the radial distance r are known as central potentials. Central potentials have spherical symmetry, and so rather than specifying the position of the electron in the usual Cartesian coordinates (x, y, z), it is more convenient to use polar spherical coordinates centered at the nucleus, consisting of a linear coordinate r and two angular coordinates, usually specified by the Greek letters theta (θ) and phi (Φ). These coordinates are similar to the ones used in GPS devices and most smart phones that track positions on our (nearly) spherical earth, with the two angular coordinates specified by the latitude and longitude, and the linear coordinate specified by sea-level elevation. Because of the spherical symmetry of central potentials, the energy and angular momentum of the classical hydrogen atom are constants, and the orbits are constrained to lie in a plane like the planets orbiting the sun. This classical mechanics description of the atom is incomplete, however, since an electron moving in an elliptical orbit would be accelerating (by changing direction) and, according to classical electromagnetism, it should continuously emit electromagnetic radiation. This loss in orbital energy should result in the electron’s orbit getting continually smaller until it spirals into the nucleus, implying that atoms are inherently unstable. In 1913, Niels Bohr attempted to resolve the atomic paradox by ignoring classical electromagnetism’s prediction that the orbiting electron in hydrogen would continuously emit light. Instead, he incorporated into the classical mechanics description of the atom Planck’s ideas of quantization and Einstein’s finding that light consists of photons whose energy is proportional to their frequency. Bohr assumed that the electron orbiting the nucleus would not normally emit any radiation (the stationary state hypothesis), but it would emit or absorb a photon if it moved to a different orbit. The energy absorbed or emitted would reflect differences in the orbital energies according to this equation: hc hν = ∣ΔE ∣= ∣Ef −Ei ∣= λ In this equation, h is Planck’s constant and Ei and Ef are the initial and final orbital energies, respectively. The absolute value of the energy difference is used, since frequencies and wavelengths are always positive. Instead of allowing for continuous values for the angular momentum, energy, and orbit radius, Bohr assumed that only discrete values for these could occur (actually, quantizing any one of these would imply that the other two are also quantized). Bohr’s expression for the quantized energies is: −k En = , n = 1, 2, 3, … n2 In this expression, k is a constant comprising fundamental constants such as the electron mass and charge and Planck’s constant.

Since the Rydberg constant was one of the most precisely measured constants at that time, this level of agreement was astonishing and meant that Bohr’s model was taken seriously, despite the many assumptions that Bohr needed to derive it. Figure 6.14. The lowest few energy levels are shown in One of the fundamental laws of physics is that matter is most stable with the lowest possible energy. Thus, the electron in a hydrogen atom usually moves in the n = 1 orbit, the orbit in which it has the lowest energy. When the electron is in this lowest energy orbit, the atom is said to be in its ground electronic state (or simply ground state). If the atom receives energy from an outside source, it is possible for the electron to move to an orbit with a higher n value and the atom is now in an excited electronic state (or simply an excited state) with a higher energy. When an electron transitions from an excited state (higher energy orbit) to a less excited state, or ground state, the difference in energy is emitted as a photon. Similarly, if a photon is absorbed by an atom, the energy of the photon moves an electron from a lower energy orbit up to a more excited one. We can relate the energy of electrons in atoms to what we learned previously about energy. The law of conservation of energy says that we can neither create nor destroy energy. Thus, if a certain amount of external energy is required to excite an electron from one energy level to another, that same amount of energy will be liberated when the electron returns to (Figure 6.15). its initial state In effect, an atom can “store” energy by using it to promote an electron to a state with a higher energy and release it when the electron returns to a lower state. The energy can be released as one quantum of energy, as the electron returns to its ground state (say, from n = 5 to n = 1), or it can be released as two or more smaller quanta as the electron falls to an intermediate state, then to the ground state (say, from n = 5 to n = 4, emitting one quantum, then to n = 1, emitting a second quantum). He+, Li2+, Since Bohr’s model involved only a single electron, it could also be applied to the single electron ions Be3+, and so forth, which differ from hydrogen only in their nuclear charges, and so one-electron atoms and ions are collectively referred to as hydrogen-like atoms. The energy expression for hydrogen-like atoms is a generalization of the hydrogen atom energy, in which Z is the nuclear charge (+1 for hydrogen, +2 for He, +3 for Li, and so on) and k 10–18 × J. has a value of 2.179 −kZ2 En = n2 The sizes of the circular orbits for hydrogen-like atoms are given in terms of their radii by the following expression, 10−11 α0 × in which is a constant called the Bohr radius, with a value of 5.292 m: n2 r = a0 Z The equation also shows us that as the electron’s energy increases (as n increases), the electron is found at greater distances from the nucleus. This is implied by the inverse dependence on r in the Coulomb potential, since, as the electron moves away from the nucleus, the electrostatic attraction between it and the nucleus decreases, and it is held less tightly in the atom. Note that as n gets larger and the orbits get larger, their energies get closer to zero, and so the n ⟶∞n ⟶∞, r ⟶∞r ⟶∞imply limits and that E = 0 corresponds to the ionization limit where the

Thus, for hydrogen in the ground state n = 1, the ionization energy would be: ΔE = En ⟶∞−E1 = 0 + k = k With three extremely puzzling paradoxes now solved (blackbody radiation, the photoelectric effect, and the hydrogen atom), and all involving Planck’s constant in a fundamental manner, it became clear to most physicists at that time that the classical theories that worked so well in the macroscopic world were fundamentally flawed and could not be extended down into the microscopic domain of atoms and molecules. Unfortunately, despite Bohr’s remarkable achievement in deriving a theoretical expression for the Rydberg constant, he was unable to extend his theory to the next simplest atom, He, which only has two electrons. Bohr’s model was severely flawed, since it was still based on the classical mechanics notion of precise orbits, a concept that was later found to be untenable in the microscopic domain, when a proper model of quantum mechanics was developed to supersede classical mechanics.

It does introduce several important features of all models used to describe the distribution of electrons in an atom. These features include the following: The energies of electrons (energy levels) in an atom are quantized, described by quantum numbers: integer • numbers having only specific allowed value and used to characterize the arrangement of electrons in an atom. An electron’s energy increases with increasing distance from the nucleus. • The discrete energies (lines) in the spectra of the elements result from quantized electronic energies. • Of these features, the most important is the postulate of quantized energy levels for an electron in an atom. As a consequence, the model laid the foundation for the quantum mechanical model of the atom. Bohr won a Nobel Prize in Physics for his contributions to our understanding of the structure of atoms and how that is related to line spectra emissions. https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

Why did electrons orbit at only fixed distances defined by a single quantum number n = 1, 2, 3, and so on, but never in between? Why did the model work so well describing hydrogen and one-electron ions, but could not correctly predict the emission spectrum for helium or any larger atoms? To answer these questions, scientists needed to completely revise the way they thought about matter. Behavior in the Microscopic World We know how matter behaves in the macroscopic world—objects that are large enough to be seen by the naked eye follow the rules of classical physics. A billiard ball moving on a table will behave like a particle: It will continue in a straight line unless it collides with another ball or the table cushion, or is acted on by some other force (such as friction). The ball has a well-defined position and velocity (or a well-defined momentum, p = mv, defined by mass m and velocity v) at any given moment. In other words, the ball is moving in a classical trajectory. This is the typical behavior of a classical object. When waves interact with each other, they show interference patterns that are not displayed by macroscopic particles such as the billiard ball. For example, interacting waves on the surface of water can produce interference patters Figure 6.16. similar to those shown on This is a case of wave behavior on the macroscopic scale, and it is clear that particles and waves are very different phenomena in the macroscopic realm. Figure 6.16 An interference pattern on the water surface is formed by interacting waves. The waves are caused by reflection of water from the rocks. (credit: modification of work by Sukanto Debnath) As technological improvements allowed scientists to probe the microscopic world in greater detail, it became increasingly clear by the 1920s that very small pieces of matter follow a different set of rules from those we observe for large objects. The unquestionable separation of waves and particles was no longer the case for the microscopic world. One of the first people to pay attention to the special behavior of the microscopic world was Louis de Broglie. He asked the question: If electromagnetic radiation can have particle-like character, can electrons and other submicroscopic particles exhibit wavelike character?

302 Chapter 6 | Electronic Structure and Periodic Properties of Elements wave–particle duality of light that Einstein used to resolve the photoelectric-effect paradox to material particles. He predicted that a particle with mass m and velocity v (that is, with linear momentum p) should also exhibit the behavior of a wave with a wavelength value λ, given by this expression in which h is the familiar Planck’s constant: h hp λ = = mv This is called the de Broglie wavelength. Unlike the other values of λ discussed in this chapter, the de Broglie wavelength is a characteristic of particles and other bodies, not electromagnetic radiation (note that this equation involves velocity [v, m/s], not frequency [ν, Hz]. Although these two symbols are identical, they mean very different things). Where Bohr had postulated the electron as being a particle orbiting the nucleus in quantized orbits, de Broglie argued that Bohr’s assumption of quantization can be explained if the electron is considered not as a particle, but rather as a circular standing wave such that only an integer number of wavelengths could fit exactly within the orbit (Figure 6.17). Figure 6.17 If an electron is viewed as a wave circling around the nucleus, an integer number of wavelengths must fit into the orbit for this standing wave behavior to be possible. For a circular orbit of radius r, the circumference is 2πr, and so de Broglie’s condition is: 3, … 2πr = nλ, n = 1, 2, Since the de Broglie expression relates the wavelength to the momentum and, hence, velocity, this implies: nhp nh nhr nhr 2πr = nλ = = = = mv mvr L This expression can be rearranged to give Bohr’s formula for the quantization of the angular momentum: nh L = = nℏ 2π Classical angular momentum L for a circular motion is equal to the product of the radius of the circle and the momentum of the moving particle p.

Shortly after de Broglie proposed the wave nature of matter, two scientists at Bell Laboratories, C. J. Davisson and L. H. Germer, demonstrated experimentally that electrons can exhibit wavelike behavior by showing an interference pattern for electrons travelling through a regular atomic pattern in a crystal. The regularly spaced atomic layers served as slits, as used in other interference experiments. Since the spacing between the layers serving as slits needs to be similar in size to the wavelength of the tested wave for an interference pattern to form, Davisson and Germer used a crystalline nickel target for their “slits,” since the spacing of the atoms within the lattice was approximately the Figure 6.19 same as the de Broglie wavelengths of the electrons that they used. shows an interference pattern. It Figure 6.6. is strikingly similar to the interference patterns for light shown in The wave–particle duality of matter Figure 6.19 can be seen in by observing what happens if electron collisions are recorded over a long period of time. Initially, when only a few electrons have been recorded, they show clear particle-like behavior, having arrived in small localized packets that appear to be random. As more and more electrons arrived and were recorded, a clear interference pattern that is the hallmark of wavelike behavior emerged. Thus, it appears that while electrons are small localized particles, their motion does not follow the equations of motion implied by classical mechanics, but instead it is governed by some type of a wave equation that governs a probability distribution even for a single electron’s motion. Thus the wave–particle duality first observed with photons is actually a fundamental behavior intrinsic to all quantum particles.

304 Chapter 6 | Electronic Structure and Periodic Properties of Elements Figure 6.19 (a) The interference pattern for electrons passing through very closely spaced slits demonstrates that quantum particles such as electrons can exhibit wavelike behavior. (b) The experimental results illustrated here demonstrate the wave–particle duality in electrons. The electrons pass through very closely spaced slits, forming an interference pattern, with increasing numbers of electrons being recorded from the left image to the right. With only a few electrons recorded, it is clear that the electrons arrive as individual localized “particles,” but in a seemingly random pattern. As more electrons arrive, a wavelike interference pattern begins to emerge. Note that the probability of the final electron location is still governed by the wave-type distribution, even for a single electron, but it can be observed more easily if many electron collisions have been recorded.

This size is the same order of magnitude as the size of an atom. This means that electron wavelike behavior is going to be noticeable in an atom. Check Your Learning s–1, Calculate the wavelength of a softball with a mass of 100 g traveling at a velocity of 35 m assuming that it can be modeled as a single particle. 10–34 × Answer: 1.9 m. We never think of a thrown softball having a wavelength, since this wavelength is so small it is impossible for our senses or any known instrument to detect (strictly speaking, the wavelength of a real baseball would correspond to the wavelengths of its constituent atoms and molecules, which, while much larger than this value, would still be microscopically tiny). The de Broglie wavelength is only appreciable for matter that has a very small mass and/or a very high velocity. Werner Heisenberg considered the limits of how accurately we can measure properties of an electron or other microscopic particles. He determined that there is a fundamental limit to how accurately one can measure both a particle’s position and its momentum simultaneously. The more accurately we measure the momentum of a particle, the less accurately we can determine its position at that time, and vice versa. This is summed up in what we now call the Heisenberg uncertainty principle: It is fundamentally impossible to determine simultaneously and exactly both the momentum and the position of a particle. For a particle of mass m moving with velocity vx in the x direction (or equivalently with momentum px), the product of the uncertainty in the position, Δx, and the uncertainty in the h ℏ ℏ= 2π, momentum, Δpx , must be greater than or equal to (recall that the value of Planck’s constant divided 2 by 2π). ≥ℏ (Δx)(mΔv) Δx × Δpx = 2 This equation allows us to calculate the limit to how precisely we can know both the simultaneous position of an object and its momentum. For example, if we improve our measurement of an electron’s position so that the (10–12 uncertainty in the position (Δx) has a value of, say, 1 pm m, about 1% of the diameter of a hydrogen atom), then our determination of its momentum must have an uncertainty with a value of at least ⎛ /s⎞ ⎡ ⎤ 10−34 m2 ⎝1.055 × kg ⎠ h 10−23 ⎣Δp ⎦= = 5 × kg m/s. = mΔv = ⎛ m⎞ (2Δx) 10−12 ⎝2 × 1 × ⎠

306 Chapter 6 | Electronic Structure and Periodic Properties of Elements The value of ħ is not large, so the uncertainty in the position or momentum of a macroscopic object like a baseball is too insignificant to observe. However, the mass of a microscopic object such as an electron is small enough that the uncertainty can be large and significant. It should be noted that Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle is not just limited to uncertainties in position and momentum, but it also links other dynamical variables. For example, when an atom absorbs a photon and makes a transition from one energy state to another, the uncertainty in the energy and the uncertainty in the time required for ≥ℏ 2. the transition are similarly related, as ΔE Δt As will be discussed later, even the vector components of angular momentum cannot all be specified exactly simultaneously. Heisenberg’s principle imposes ultimate limits on what is knowable in science. The uncertainty principle can be shown to be a consequence of wave–particle duality, which lies at the heart of what distinguishes modern quantum theory from classical mechanics. Recall that the equations of motion obtained from classical mechanics are trajectories where, at any given instant in time, both the position and the momentum of a particle can be determined exactly. Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle implies that such a view is untenable in the microscopic domain and that there are fundamental limitations governing the motion of quantum particles. This does not mean that microscopic particles do not move in trajectories, it is just that measurements of trajectories are limited in their precision. In the realm of quantum mechanics, measurements introduce changes into the system that is being observed.

The Quantum–Mechanical Model of an Atom Shortly after de Broglie published his ideas that the electron in a hydrogen atom could be better thought of as being a circular standing wave instead of a particle moving in quantized circular orbits, as Bohr had argued, Erwin Schrödinger extended de Broglie’s work by incorporating the de Broglie relation into a wave equation, deriving what is today known as the Schrödinger equation. When Schrödinger applied his equation to hydrogen-like atoms, he was able to reproduce Bohr’s expression for the energy and, thus, the Rydberg formula governing hydrogen spectra, and he did so without having to invoke Bohr’s assumptions of stationary states and quantized orbits, angular momenta, and energies; quantization in Schrödinger’s theory was a natural consequence of the underlying mathematics of the wave equation. Like de Broglie, Schrödinger initially viewed the electron in hydrogen as being a physical wave instead of a particle, but where de Broglie thought of the electron in terms of circular stationary waves, Schrödinger properly thought in terms of three-dimensional stationary waves, or wavefunctions, represented by the Greek letter psi, ψ. A few years later, Max Born proposed an interpretation of the wavefunction ψ that is still accepted today: Electrons are still particles, and so the waves represented by ψ are not physical waves but, instead, are complex probability ∣ψ∣2 describes the probability of the quantum particle amplitudes. The square of the magnitude of a wavefunction being present near a certain location in space. This means that wavefunctions can be used to determine the distribution of the electron’s density with respect to the nucleus in an atom.

Understanding Quantum Theory of Electrons in Atoms The goal of this section is to understand the electron orbitals (location of electrons in atoms), their different energies, and other properties. The use of quantum theory provides the best understanding to these topics. This knowledge is a precursor to chemical bonding. As was described previously, electrons in atoms can exist only on discrete energy levels but not between them. It is said that the energy of an electron in an atom is quantized, that is, it can be equal only to certain specific values and can jump from one energy level to another but not transition smoothly or stay between these levels. The energy levels are labeled with an n value, where n = 1, 2, 3, …. Generally speaking, the energy of an electron in atom is greater for greater values of n. This number, n, is referred to as the principle quantum number. The principle quantum number defines the location of the energy level. It is essentially the same concept as the n in the Bohr atom description. Another name for the principal quantum number is the shell number. The shells of an atom can be thought of concentric circles radiating out from the nucleus. The electrons that belong to a specific shell are most likely to be found within the corresponding circular area. The further we proceed from the nucleus, the higher the shell (Figure 6.20). number, and so the higher the energy level The positively charged protons in the nucleus stabilize the electronic orbitals by electrostatic attraction between the positive charges of the protons and the negative charges of the electrons. So the further away the electron is from the nucleus, the greater the energy it has. Figure 6.20 Different shells are numbered by principle quantum numbers.

308 Chapter 6 | Electronic Structure and Periodic Properties of Elements This quantum mechanical model for where electrons reside in an atom can be used to look at electronic transitions, the events when an electron moves from one energy level to another. If the transition is to a higher energy level, energy is absorbed, and the energy change has a positive value. To obtain the amount of energy necessary for the transition to a higher energy level, a photon is absorbed by the atom. A transition to a lower energy level involves a release of energy, and the energy change is negative. This process is accompanied by emission of a photon by the atom. The following equation summarizes these relationships and is based on the hydrogen atom: ΔE = Efina −Einitial ⎛ ⎞ ⎜1 ⎟J −1 10−18 = −2.18 × ⎝ ⎠ 2 2 nf ni Example 6.5 The values nf and ni are the final and initial energy states of the electron. in the previous section of the chapter demonstrates calculations of such energy changes. The principal quantum number is one of three quantum numbers used to characterize an orbital. An atomic orbital, which is distinct from an orbit, is a general region in an atom within which an electron is most probable to reside. The quantum mechanical model specifies the probability of finding an electron in the three-dimensional space around the nucleus and is based on solutions of the Schrödinger equation. In addition, the principle quantum number defines the energy of an electron in a hydrogen or hydrogen-like atom or an ion (an atom or an ion with only one electron) and the general region in which discrete energy levels of electrons in a multi-electron atoms and ions are located. Another quantum number is l, the angular momentum quantum number. It is an integer that defines the shape of the orbital, and takes on the values, l = 0, 1, 2, …, n – 1. This means that an orbital with n = 1 can have only one value of l, l = 0, whereas n = 2 permits l = 0 and l = 1, and so on. The principal quantum number defines the general size and energy of the orbital. The l value specifies the shape of the orbital. Orbitals with the same value of l form a subshell. In addition, the greater the angular momentum quantum number, the greater is the angular momentum of an electron at this orbital. Orbitals with l = 0 are called s orbitals (or the s subshells). The value l = 1 corresponds to the p orbitals. For a given n, p orbitals constitute a p subshell (e.g., 3p if n = 3). The orbitals with l = 2 are called the d orbitals, followed by the f-, g-, and h-orbitals for l = 3, 4, 5, and there are higher values we will not consider. There are certain distances from the nucleus at which the probability density of finding an electron located at a particular orbital is zero. In other words, the value of the wavefunction ψ is zero at this distance for this orbital. Such a value of radius r is called a radial node. The number of radial nodes in an orbital is n – l – 1. https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

Figure 6.21. Consider the examples in The orbitals depicted are of the s type, thus l = 0 for all of them. It can be seen from the graphs of the probability densities that there are 1 – 0 – 1 = 0 places where the density is zero (nodes) for 1s (n = 1), 2 – 0 – 1 = 1 node for 2s, and 3 – 0 – 1 = 2 nodes for the 3s orbitals. The s subshell electron density distribution is spherical and the p subshell has a dumbbell shape. The d and f orbitals are more complex. These shapes represent the three-dimensional regions within which the electron is likely to be found.

Chapter 6 | Electronic Structure and Periodic Properties of Elements 311 the z direction, orbitals with different values of the z component of the angular momentum will have different energies resulting from interacting with the field. The magnetic quantum number, called ml, specifies the z component of the angular momentum for a particular orbital. For example, for an s orbital, l = 0, and the only value of ml is zero. For p orbitals, l = 1, and ml can be equal to –1, 0, or +1. Generally speaking, ml can be equal to –l, –(l – 1), …, –1, 0, +1, …, (l – 1), l. The total number of possible orbitals with the same value of l (a subshell) is 2l + 1. Thus, there is one s orbital for a specific value of n, there are three p orbitals for n ≥2, four d orbitals for n ≥3, five f orbitals for n ≥4, and so forth. The principle quantum number defines the general value of the electronic energy. The angular momentum quantum number determines the shape of the orbital. And the magnetic quantum number specifies orientation of the Figure 6.22. orbital in space, as can be seen in Figure 6.23 The chart shows the energies of electron orbitals in a multi-electron atom. Figure 6.23 illustrates the energy levels for various orbitals. The number before the orbital name (such as 2s, 3p, and so forth) stands for the principle quantum number, n. The letter in the orbital name defines the subshell with a specific angular momentum quantum number l = 0 for s orbitals, 1 for p orbitals, 2 for d orbitals. Finally, there are more than one possible orbitals for l ≥1, each corresponding to a specific value of ml. In the case of a hydrogen atom or a one- He+, Li+, electron ion (such as and so on), energies of all the orbitals with the same n are the same. This is called a degeneracy, and the energy levels for the same principle quantum number, n, are called degenerate energy levels. However, in atoms with more than one electron, this degeneracy is eliminated by the electron–electron interactions, Figure 6.23. and orbitals that belong to different subshells have different energies, as shown on Orbitals within the same subshell (for example ns, np, nd, nf, such as 2p, 3s) are still degenerate and have the same energy. While the three quantum numbers discussed in the previous paragraphs work well for describing electron orbitals, some experiments showed that they were not sufficient to explain all observed results. It was demonstrated in the 1920s that when hydrogen-line spectra are examined at extremely high resolution, some lines are actually not single peaks but, rather, pairs of closely spaced lines. This is the so-called fine structure of the spectrum, and it implies that there are additional small differences in energies of electrons even when they are located in the same orbital. These observations led Samuel Goudsmit and George Uhlenbeck to propose that electrons have a fourth quantum number. They called this the spin quantum number, or ms. The other three quantum numbers, n, l, and ml, are properties of specific atomic orbitals that also define in what part of the space an electron is most likely to be located. Orbitals are a result of solving the Schrödinger equation for electrons in atoms. The electron spin is a different kind of property. It is a completely quantum phenomenon with no analogues in the classical realm. In addition, it cannot be derived from solving the Schrödinger equation and is not related to the normal spatial coordinates (such as the Cartesian x, y, and z). Electron spin describes an intrinsic electron

This is why an electron with 2 −1 ms = and an electron with has a slightly higher energy in the same field. This is true even for an electron 2 occupying the same orbital in an atom. A spectral line corresponding to a transition for electrons from the same orbital but with different spin quantum numbers has two possible values of energy; thus, the line in the spectrum will show a fine structure splitting. The Pauli Exclusion Principle An electron in an atom is completely described by four quantum numbers: n, l, ml, and ms. The first three quantum numbers define the orbital and the fourth quantum number describes the intrinsic electron property called spin. An Austrian physicist Wolfgang Pauli formulated a general principle that gives the last piece of information that we need to understand the general behavior of electrons in atoms. The Pauli exclusion principle can be formulated as follows: No two electrons in the same atom can have exactly the same set of all the four quantum numbers. What this means is that electrons can share the same orbital (the same set of the quantum numbers n, l, and ml), but only if their spin ⎛ ⎞ 1 ⎝± ⎠, quantum numbers ms have different values.

Thus, there is only one 4s orbital. For l = 1 (p-type orbitals), m can have values of –1, 0, +1, so we find three 4p orbitals. For l = 2 (d-type orbitals), ml can have values of –2, –1, 0, +1, +2, so we have five 4d orbitals. When l = 3 (f-type orbitals), ml can have values of –3, –2, –1, 0, +1, +2, +3, and we can have seven 4f orbitals. Thus, we find a total of 16 orbitals in the n = 4 shell of an atom.

This allows us to determine which orbitals are occupied by electrons in each atom. The specific arrangement of electrons in orbitals of an atom determines many of the chemical properties of that atom. Orbital Energies and Atomic Structure The energy of atomic orbitals increases as the principal quantum number, n, increases. In any atom with two or more electrons, the repulsion between the electrons makes energies of subshells with different values of l differ so that the Figure 6.25 energy of the orbitals increases within a shell in the order s < p < d < f. depicts how these two trends in increasing energy relate. The 1s orbital at the bottom of the diagram is the orbital with electrons of lowest energy. The energy increases as we move up to the 2s and then 2p, 3s, and 3p orbitals, showing that the increasing n value has more influence on energy than the increasing l value for small atoms. However, this pattern does not hold for larger atoms. The 3d orbital is higher in energy than the 4s orbital. Such overlaps continue to occur frequently as we move up the chart.

316 Chapter 6 | Electronic Structure and Periodic Properties of Elements Figure 6.25 Generalized energy-level diagram for atomic orbitals in an atom with two or more electrons (not to scale). Electrons in successive atoms on the periodic table tend to fill low-energy orbitals first. Thus, many students find it confusing that, for example, the 5p orbitals fill immediately after the 4d, and immediately before the 6s. The filling order is based on observed experimental results, and has been confirmed by theoretical calculations. As the principal quantum number, n, increases, the size of the orbital increases and the electrons spend more time farther from the nucleus. Thus, the attraction to the nucleus is weaker and the energy associated with the orbital is higher (less stabilized). But this is not the only effect we have to take into account. Within each shell, as the value of l increases, the electrons are less penetrating (meaning there is less electron density found close to the nucleus), in the order s > p > d > f. Electrons that are closer to the nucleus slightly repel electrons that are farther out, offsetting the more dominant electron–nucleus attractions slightly (recall that all electrons have −1 charges, but nuclei have +Z charges). This phenomenon is called shielding and will be discussed in more detail in the next section. Electrons in orbitals that experience more shielding are less stabilized and thus higher in energy. For small orbitals (1s through 3p), the increase in energy due to n is more significant than the increase due to l; however, for larger orbitals the two trends are comparable and cannot be simply predicted. We will discuss methods for remembering the observed order. The arrangement of electrons in the orbitals of an atom is called the electron configuration of the atom. We describe (Figure 6.26): an electron configuration with a symbol that contains three pieces of information The number of the principal quantum shell, n, 1.

Beginning with hydrogen, and continuing across the periods of the periodic table, we add one proton at a time to the nucleus and one electron to the proper subshell until we have described the electron configurations of all the elements. This procedure is called the Aufbau principle, from the German word Aufbau (“to build up”). Figure 6.25), Each added electron occupies the subshell of lowest energy available (in the order shown in subject to the limitations imposed by the allowed quantum numbers according to the Pauli exclusion principle. Electrons Figure 6.27 enter higher-energy subshells only after lower-energy subshells have been filled to capacity. illustrates the traditional way to remember the filling order for atomic orbitals. Since the arrangement of the periodic table Figure 6.28 is based on the electron configurations, provides an alternative method for determining the electron configuration. The filling order simply begins at hydrogen and includes each subshell as you proceed in increasing Z order. For example, after filling the 3p block up to Ar, we see the orbital will be 4s (K, Ca), followed by the 3d orbitals. Figure 6.27 The arrow leads through each subshell in the appropriate filling order for electron configurations. This chart is straightforward to construct. Simply make a column for all the s orbitals with each n shell on a separate row. Repeat for p, d, and f. Be sure to only include orbitals allowed by the quantum numbers (no 1p or 2d, and so forth). Finally, draw diagonal lines from top to bottom as shown.

318 Chapter 6 | Electronic Structure and Periodic Properties of Elements Figure 6.28 This periodic table shows the electron configuration for each subshell. By “building up” from hydrogen, this table can be used to determine the electron configuration for any atom on the periodic table. We will now construct the ground-state electron configuration and orbital diagram for a selection of atoms in the first and second periods of the periodic table. Orbital diagrams are pictorial representations of the electron configuration, showing the individual orbitals and the pairing arrangement of electrons. We start with a single hydrogen atom Figure 6.27 Figure 6.28, (atomic number 1), which consists of one proton and one electron. Referring to or we 1 ms = + would expect to find the electron in the 1s orbital. By convention, the value is usually filled first. The 2 electron configuration and the orbital diagram are: Following hydrogen is the noble gas helium, which has an atomic number of 2. The helium atom contains two protons and two electrons. The first electron has the same four quantum numbers as the hydrogen atom electron (n = 1, l = 1 ms = + ). The second electron also goes into the 1s orbital and fills that orbital. The second electron 0, ml = 0, 2 −1 ms = 2. has the same n, l, and ml quantum numbers, but must have the opposite spin quantum number, This is in accord with the Pauli exclusion principle: No two electrons in the same atom can have the same set of four quantum numbers. For orbital diagrams, this means two arrows go in each box (representing two electrons in each orbital) https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

Chapter 6 | Electronic Structure and Periodic Properties of Elements 319 and the arrows must point in opposite directions (representing paired spins). The electron configuration and orbital diagram of helium are: The n = 1 shell is completely filled in a helium atom. The next atom is the alkali metal lithium with an atomic number of 3. The first two electrons in lithium fill the 1s orbital and have the same sets of four quantum numbers as the two electrons in helium. The remaining electron (Figure 6.27 Figure 6.28). must occupy the orbital of next lowest energy, the 2s orbital or Thus, the electron configuration and orbital diagram of lithium are: An atom of the alkaline earth metal beryllium, with an atomic number of 4, contains four protons in the nucleus and four electrons surrounding the nucleus. The fourth electron fills the remaining space in the 2s orbital. An atom of boron (atomic number 5) contains five electrons. The n = 1 shell is filled with two electrons and three electrons will occupy the n = 2 shell. Because any s subshell can contain only two electrons, the fifth electron must occupy the next energy level, which will be a 2p orbital. There are three degenerate 2p orbitals (ml = −1, 0, +1) and the electron can occupy any one of these p orbitals. When drawing orbital diagrams, we include empty boxes to depict any empty orbitals in the same subshell that we are filling. Carbon (atomic number 6) has six electrons. Four of them fill the 1s and 2s orbitals. The remaining two electrons occupy the 2p subshell. We now have a choice of filling one of the 2p orbitals and pairing the electrons or of leaving the electrons unpaired in two different, but degenerate, p orbitals. The orbitals are filled as described by Hund’s rule: the lowest-energy configuration for an atom with electrons within a set of degenerate orbitals is that having the maximum number of unpaired electrons. Thus, the two electrons in the carbon 2p orbitals have identical n, l, and ms quantum numbers and differ in their ml quantum number (in accord with the Pauli exclusion principle). The electron configuration and orbital diagram for carbon are: Nitrogen (atomic number 7) fills the 1s and 2s subshells and has one electron in each of the three 2p orbitals, in accordance with Hund’s rule. These three electrons have unpaired spins. Oxygen (atomic number 8) has a pair of electrons in any one of the 2p orbitals (the electrons have opposite spins) and a single electron in each of the other two. Fluorine (atomic number 9) has only one 2p orbital containing an unpaired electron. All of the electrons in the noble gas neon (atomic number 10) are paired, and all of the orbitals in the n = 1 and the n = 2 shells are filled. The electron configurations and orbital diagrams of these four elements are:

320 Chapter 6 | Electronic Structure and Periodic Properties of Elements The alkali metal sodium (atomic number 11) has one more electron than the neon atom. This electron must go into 1s22s22p63s1 the lowest-energy subshell available, the 3s orbital, giving a configuration. The electrons occupying the outermost shell orbital(s) (highest value of n) are called valence electrons, and those occupying the inner shell (Figure 6.29). orbitals are called core electrons Since the core electron shells correspond to noble gas electron configurations, we can abbreviate electron configurations by writing the noble gas that matches the core electron configuration, along with the valence electrons in a condensed format. For our sodium example, the symbol [Ne] (1s22s22p6) [Ne]3s1. represents core electrons, and our abbreviated or condensed configuration is Figure 6.29 A core-abbreviated electron configuration (right) replaces the core electrons with the noble gas symbol whose configuration matches the core electron configuration of the other element. [He]2s1, Similarly, the abbreviated configuration of lithium can be represented as where [He] represents the configuration of the helium atom, which is identical to that of the filled inner shell of lithium. Writing the configurations in this way emphasizes the similarity of the configurations of lithium and sodium. Both atoms, which are in the alkali metal family, have only one electron in a valence s subshell outside a filled set of inner shells. [He]2s1 Li: [Ne]3s1 Na: [Ne]3s2 The alkaline earth metal magnesium (atomic number 12), with its 12 electrons in a configuration, is [He]2s2. analogous to its family member beryllium, Both atoms have a filled s subshell outside their filled inner [Ne]3s23p1, shells.

Figure 6.30 This version of the periodic table shows the outer-shell electron configuration of each element. Note that down each group, the configuration is often similar. When we come to the next element in the periodic table, the alkali metal potassium (atomic number 19), we might expect that we would begin to add electrons to the 3d subshell. However, all available chemical and physical evidence indicates that potassium is like lithium and sodium, and that the next electron is not added to the 3d level but is, (Figure 6.30). instead, added to the 4s level As discussed previously, the 3d orbital with no radial nodes is higher in energy because it is less penetrating and more shielded from the nucleus than the 4s, which has three radial [Ar]4s1. nodes. Thus, potassium has an electron configuration of Hence, potassium corresponds to Li and Na in its valence shell configuration. The next electron is added to complete the 4s subshell and calcium has an electron [Ar]4s2. configuration of This gives calcium an outer-shell electron configuration corresponding to that of beryllium and magnesium. Beginning with the transition metal scandium (atomic number 21), additional electrons are added successively to the 3d subshell. This subshell is filled to its capacity with 10 electrons (remember that for l = 2 [d orbitals], there are 2l + 1 = 5 values of ml, meaning that there are five d orbitals that have a combined capacity of 10 electrons). The 4p subshell fills next. Note that for three series of elements, scandium (Sc) through copper (Cu), yttrium (Y) through silver (Ag), and lutetium (Lu) through gold (Au), a total of 10 d electrons are successively added to the (n – 1) shell next to the n shell to bring that (n – 1) shell from 8 to 18 electrons. For two series, lanthanum (La) through lutetium

Example 6.10 Quantum Numbers and Electron Configurations What is the electron configuration and orbital diagram for a phosphorus atom? What are the four quantum numbers for the last electron added? Solution The atomic number of phosphorus is 15. Thus, a phosphorus atom contains 15 electrons. The order of filling of the energy levels is 1s, 2s, 2p, 3s, 3p, 4s, . . . The 15 electrons of the phosphorus atom will fill up to the 3p orbital, which will contain three electrons: The last electron added is a 3p electron. Therefore, n = 3 and, for a p-type orbital, l = 1. The ml value could be –1, 0, or +1. The three p orbitals are degenerate, so any of these ml values is correct.

However, we do find Figure 6.27 Figure 6.28. exceptions to the order of filling of orbitals that are shown in or For instance, the electron Figure 6.30) configurations (shown in of the transition metals chromium (Cr; atomic number 24) and copper (Cu; atomic number 29), among others, are not those we would expect. In general, such exceptions involve subshells with very similar energy, and small effects can lead to changes in the order of filling. In the case of Cr and Cu, we find that half-filled and completely filled subshells apparently represent conditions of preferred stability. This stability is such that an electron shifts from the 4s into the 3d orbital to gain the extra stability 3d subshell (in Cr) or a filled 3d subshell (in Cu). Other exceptions also occur. For example, niobium of a half-filled [Kr]5s24d3. (Nb, atomic number 41) is predicted to have the electron configuration Experimentally, we observe that [Kr]5s14d4. its ground-state electron configuration is actually We can rationalize this observation by saying that the electron–electron repulsions experienced by pairing the electrons in the 5s orbital are larger than the gap in energy between the 5s and 4d orbitals. There is no simple method to predict the exceptions for atoms where the magnitude of the repulsions between electrons is greater than the small differences in energy between subshells. Electron Configurations and the Periodic Table As described earlier, the periodic table arranges atoms based on increasing atomic number so that elements with the (Figure 6.30), same chemical properties recur periodically. When their electron configurations are added to the table we also see a periodic recurrence of similar electron configurations in the outer shells of these elements. Because they are in the outer shells of an atom, valence electrons play the most important role in chemical reactions.

Chapter 6 | Electronic Structure and Periodic Properties of Elements 323 electrons have the highest energy of the electrons in an atom and are most easily lost or shared than the core electrons. Valence electrons are also the determining factor in some physical properties of the elements. Elements in any one group (or column) have the same number of valence electrons; the alkali metals lithium and sodium each have only one valence electron, the alkaline earth metals beryllium and magnesium each have two, and the halogens fluorine and chlorine each have seven valence electrons. The similarity in chemical properties among elements of the same group occurs because they have the same number of valence electrons. It is the loss, gain, or sharing of valence electrons that defines how elements react. It is important to remember that the periodic table was developed on the basis of the chemical behavior of the elements, well before any idea of their atomic structure was available. Now we can understand why the periodic table has the arrangement it has—the arrangement puts elements whose atoms have the same number of valence electrons Figure 6.30, in the same group. This arrangement is emphasized in which shows in periodic-table form the electron Figure 6.30 configuration of the last subshell to be filled by the Aufbau principle. The colored sections of show the three categories of elements classified by the orbitals being filled: main group, transition, and inner transition elements. These classifications determine which orbitals are counted in the valence shell, or highest energy level orbitals of an atom. Main group elements (sometimes called representative elements) are those in which the last electron added 1. Figure 6.30. enters an s or a p orbital in the outermost shell, shown in blue and red in This category includes all the nonmetallic elements, as well as many metals and the intermediate semimetallic elements. The valence electrons for main group elements are those with the highest n level. For example, gallium (Ga, atomic number [Ar]4s23d104p1, which contains three valence electrons (underlined). The 31) has the electron configuration completely filled d orbitals count as core, not valence, electrons. Transition elements or transition metals. These are metallic elements in which the last electron added 2. enters a d orbital. The valence electrons (those added after the last noble gas configuration) in these elements include the ns and (n – 1) d electrons. The official IUPAC definition of transition elements specifies those with partially filled d orbitals. Thus, the elements with completely filled orbitals (Zn, Cd, Hg, as well as Cu, Ag, Figure 6.30) and Au in are not technically transition elements. However, the term is frequently used to refer Figure 6.30), to the entire d block (colored yellow in and we will adopt this usage in this textbook. Inner transition elements are metallic elements in which the last electron added occupies an f orbital. They 3. Figure 6.30. are shown in green in The valence shells of the inner transition elements consist of the (n – 2)f, the (n – 1)d, and the ns subshells. There are two inner transition series: The lanthanide series: lanthanide (La) through lutetium (Lu) a. The actinide series: actinide (Ac) through lawrencium (Lr) b. Lanthanum and actinium, because of their similarities to the other members of the series, are included and used to name the series, even though they are transition metals with no f electrons. Electron Configurations of Ions We have seen that ions are formed when atoms gain or lose electrons. A cation (positively charged ion) forms when one or more electrons are removed from a parent atom. For main group elements, the electrons that were added last are the first electrons removed. For transition metals and inner transition metals, however, electrons in the s orbital are easier to remove than the d or f electrons, and so the highest ns electrons are lost, and then the (n – 1)d or (n – 2)f electrons are removed. An anion (negatively charged ion) forms when one or more electrons are added to a parent atom. The added electrons fill in the order predicted by the Aufbau principle.

We have chosen to show the full, unabbreviated configurations to provide more practice for students who want it, but listing the core- abbreviated electron configurations is also acceptable. Next, determine whether an electron is gained or lost. Remember electrons are negatively charged, so ions with a positive charge have lost an electron. For main group elements, the last orbital gains or loses the electron. For transition metals, the last s orbital loses an electron before the d orbitals. 1s22s22p63s1. 1s22s22p63s1 Na+: 1s22s22p6.

This similarity occurs because the members of a group have the same number and distribution of electrons in their valence shells.

As we go across a period from left to right, we add a proton to the nucleus and an electron to the valence shell with each successive element. As we go down the elements in a group, the number of electrons in the valence shell remains constant, but the principal quantum number increases by one each time. An understanding of the electronic structure of the elements allows us to examine some of the properties that govern their chemical behavior. These properties vary periodically as the electronic structure of the elements changes. They are (1) size (radius) of atoms and ions, (2) ionization energies, and (3) electron affinities. Link to Learning Explore visualizations (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/16pertrends) of the periodic trends discussed in this section (and many more trends). With just a few clicks, you can create three-dimensional versions of the periodic table showing atomic size or graphs of ionization energies from all measured elements. Variation in Covalent Radius The quantum mechanical picture makes it difficult to establish a definite size of an atom. However, there are several practical ways to define the radius of atoms and, thus, to determine their relative sizes that give roughly similar (Figure 6.31), values. We will use the covalent radius which is defined as one-half the distance between the nuclei of two identical atoms when they are joined by a covalent bond (this measurement is possible because atoms within molecules still retain much of their atomic identity). We know that as we scan down a group, the principal quantum number, n, increases by one for each element. Thus, the electrons are being added to a region of space that is increasingly distant from the nucleus. Consequently, the size of the atom (and its covalent radius) must increase as we increase the distance of the outermost electrons from the nucleus. This trend is illustrated for the covalent radii of Table 6.2 Figure 6.31.

Chapter 6 | Electronic Structure and Periodic Properties of Elements 327 Figure 6.32 Within each period, the trend in atomic radius decreases as Z increases; for example, from K to Kr. Within each group (e.g., the alkali metals shown in purple), the trend is that atomic radius increases as Z increases. Figure 6.32, As shown in as we move across a period from left to right, we generally find that each element has a smaller covalent radius than the element preceding it. This might seem counterintuitive because it implies that atoms with more electrons have a smaller atomic radius. This can be explained with the concept of effective nuclear charge, Zeff. This is the pull exerted on a specific electron by the nucleus, taking into account any electron–electron repulsions. For hydrogen, there is only one electron and so the nuclear charge (Z) and the effective nuclear charge (Zeff) are equal. For all other atoms, the inner electrons partially shield the outer electrons from the pull of the nucleus, and thus: Zeff = Z −shielding Shielding is determined by the probability of another electron being between the electron of interest and the nucleus, as well as by the electron–electron repulsions the electron of interest encounters. Core electrons are adept at shielding, while electrons in the same valence shell do not block the nuclear attraction experienced by each other as efficiently. Thus, each time we move from one element to the next across a period, Z increases by one, but the shielding increases only slightly. Thus, Zeff increases as we move from left to right across a period. The stronger pull (higher effective nuclear charge) experienced by electrons on the right side of the periodic table draws them closer to the nucleus, making the covalent radii smaller. Thus, as we would expect, the outermost or valence electrons are easiest to remove because they have the highest energies, are shielded more, and are farthest from the nucleus. As a general rule, when the representative elements form cations, they do so by the loss of the ns or np electrons that were added last in the Aufbau process. The transition

328 Chapter 6 | Electronic Structure and Periodic Properties of Elements elements, on the other hand, lose the ns electrons before they begin to lose the (n – 1)d electrons, even though the ns electrons are added first, according to the Aufbau principle. Example 6.12 Sorting Atomic Radii Predict the order of increasing covalent radius for Ge, Fl, Br, Kr. Solution Radius increases as we move down a group, so Ge < Fl (Note: Fl is the symbol for flerovium, element 114, NOT fluorine). Radius decreases as we move across a period, so Kr < Br < Ge. Putting the trends together, we obtain Kr < Br < Ge < Fl. Check Your Learning Give an example of an atom whose size is smaller than fluorine. Answer: Ne or He Variation in Ionic Radii Ionic radius is the measure used to describe the size of an ion. A cation always has fewer electrons and the same (Figure 6.33). number of protons as the parent atom; it is smaller than the atom from which it is derived For (1s22s22p63s23p1) Al3+ example, the covalent radius of an aluminum atom is 118 pm, whereas the ionic radius of an (1s22s22p6) is 68 pm. As electrons are removed from the outer valence shell, the remaining core electrons occupying smaller shells experience a greater effective nuclear charge Zeff (as discussed) and are drawn even closer to the nucleus. Figure 6.33 The radius for a cation is smaller than the parent atom (Al), due to the lost electrons; the radius for an anion is larger than the parent (S), due to the gained electrons. V2+ Cations with larger charges are smaller than cations with smaller charges (e.g., has an ionic radius of 79 pm, while V3+ that of is 64 pm). Proceeding down the groups of the periodic table, we find that cations of successive elements with the same charge generally have larger radii, corresponding to an increase in the principal quantum number, n. is formed by the addition of one or more electrons to the valence shell of an atom. This results An anion (negative ion) in a greater repulsion among the electrons and a decrease in Zeff per electron. Both effects (the increased number of (Figure 6.33). electrons and the decreased Zeff) cause the radius of an anion to be larger than that of the parent atom ([Ne]3s23p4) For example, a sulfur atom has a covalent radius of 104 pm, whereas the ionic radius of the sulfide anion ([Ne]3s23p6) is 170 pm. For consecutive elements proceeding down any group, anions have larger principal quantum numbers and, thus, larger radii. ions that have the same electron configuration are said to be isoelectronic. Examples of isoelectronic Atoms and K+, N3–, O2–, F–, Na+, Mg2+, Al3+ (1s22s22p6). P3–, S2–, Cl–, Ar, species are Ne, and Another isoelectronic series is Ca2+, Sc3+ ([Ne]3s23p6). and For atoms or ions that are isoelectronic, the number of protons determines the size. The greater the nuclear charge, the smaller the radius in a series of isoelectronic ions and atoms. https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

Chapter 6 | Electronic Structure and Periodic Properties of Elements 329 Variation in Ionization Energies The amount of energy required to remove the most loosely bound electron from a gaseous atom in its ground state is called its first ionization energy (IE1). The first ionization energy for an element, X, is the energy required to form a cation with +1 charge: ⟶X+(g) e− X(g) + IE1 The energy required to remove the second most loosely bound electron is called the second ionization energy (IE2). ⟶X2+(g) X+(g) e− + IE2 The energy required to remove the third electron is the third ionization energy, and so on. Energy is always required to remove electrons from atoms or ions, so ionization processes are endothermic and IE values are always positive. For larger atoms, the most loosely bound electron is located farther from the nucleus and so is easier to remove. Thus, as size (atomic radius) increases, the ionization energy should decrease. Relating this logic to what we have just learned about radii, we would expect first ionization energies to decrease down a group and to increase across a period. Figure 6.34 graphs the relationship between the first ionization energy and the atomic number of several elements. Figure 6.35. The values of first ionization energy for the elements are given in Within a period, the IE1 generally increases with increasing Z. Down a group, the IE1 value generally decreases with increasing Z. There are some systematic deviations from this trend, however. Note that the ionization energy of boron (atomic number 5) is less than that of beryllium (atomic number 4) even though the nuclear charge of boron is greater by one proton. This can be explained because the energy of the subshells increases as l increases, due to penetration and shielding (as discussed previously in this chapter). Within any one shell, the s electrons are lower in energy than the p electrons. This means that an s electron is harder to remove from an atom than a p electron in the same shell. The electron removed during ([He]2s2) the ionization of beryllium is an s electron, whereas the electron removed during the ionization of boron ([He]2s22p1) is a p electron; this results in a lower first ionization energy for boron, even though its nuclear charge is greater by one proton. Thus, we see a small deviation from the predicted trend occurring each time a new subshell begins.

--- Page 339 ---
Chapter 6 | Electronic Structure and Periodic Properties of Elements 331 Another deviation occurs as orbitals become more than one-half filled. The first ionization energy for oxygen is slightly less than that for nitrogen, despite the trend in increasing IE1 values across a period. Looking at the orbital diagram of oxygen, we can see that removing one electron will eliminate the electron–electron repulsion caused by pairing the electrons in the 2p orbital and will result in a half-filled orbital (which is energetically favorable). Figure 6.35). Analogous changes occur in succeeding periods (note the dip for sulfur after phosphorus in Removing an electron from a cation is more difficult than removing an electron from a neutral atom because of the greater electrostatic attraction to the cation. Likewise, removing an electron from a cation with a higher positive charge is more difficult than removing an electron from an ion with a lower charge. Thus, successive ionization Table 6.3, energies for one element always increase. As seen in there is a large increase in the ionization energies (color change) for each element. This jump corresponds to removal of the core electrons, which are harder to remove than the valence electrons. For example, Sc and Ga both have three valence electrons, so the rapid increase in ionization energy occurs after the third ionization.

Solution 6p1 3p1 Removing the electron from Tl is easier than removing the electron from Al because the higher n orbital is farther from the nucleus, so IE1(Tl) < IE1(Al). Ionizing the third electron from (Al2+ ⟶Al3+ e−) Al2+ Al + requires more energy because the cation exerts a stronger pull on the electron than the neutral Al atom, so IE1(Al) < IE3(Al). The second ionization energy for sodium removes a core electron, which is a much higher energy process than removing valence electrons. Putting this all together, we obtain: IE1(Tl) < IE1(Al) < IE3(Al) < IE2(Na). Check Your Learning

332 Chapter 6 | Electronic Structure and Periodic Properties of Elements Which has the lowest value for IE1: O, Po, Pb, or Ba? Answer: Ba Variation in Electron Affinities The electron affinity [EA] is the energy change for the process of adding an electron to a gaseous atom to form an anion (negative ion). e−⟶X−(g) X(g) + EA1 This process can be either endothermic or exothermic, depending on the element. The EA of some of the elements is Figure 6.36. given in You can see that many of these elements have negative values of EA, which means that energy is released when the gaseous atom accepts an electron. However, for some elements, energy is required for the atom to become negatively charged and the value of their EA is positive. Just as with ionization energy, subsequent EA values are associated with forming ions with more charge. The second EA is the energy associated with adding an electron to an anion to form a –2 ion, and so on. As we might predict, it becomes easier to add an electron across a series of atoms as the effective nuclear charge of the atoms increases. We find, as we go from left to right across a period, EAs tend to become more negative. The exceptions found among the elements of group 2 (2A), group 15 (5A), and group 18 (8A) can be understood based on the electronic structure of these groups. The noble gases, group 18 (8A), have a completely filled shell and the incoming electron must be added to a higher n level, which is more difficult to do. Group 2 (2A) has a filled ns subshell, and so the next electron added goes into the higher energy np, so, again, the observed EA value is not as the Finally, group 15 (5A) has a half-filled np subshell and the next electron must be paired with an trend would predict. existing np electron. In all of these cases, the initial relative stability of the electron configuration disrupts the trend in EA. We also might expect the atom at the top of each group to have the largest EA; their first ionization potentials suggest that these atoms have the largest effective nuclear charges. However, as we move down a group, we see that the second element in the group most often has the greatest EA. The reduction of the EA of the first member can be attributed to the small size of the n = 2 shell and the resulting large electron–electron repulsions. For example, chlorine, with an EA value of –348 kJ/mol, has the highest value of any element in the periodic table. The EA of (F–), fluorine is –322 kJ/mol. When we add an electron to a fluorine atom to form a fluoride anion we add an electron to the n = 2 shell. The electron is attracted to the nucleus, but there is also significant repulsion from the other electrons already present in this small valence shell. The chlorine atom has the same electron configuration in the valence shell, but because the entering electron is going into the n = 3 shell, it occupies a considerably larger region of space and the electron–electron repulsions are reduced. The entering electron does not experience as much repulsion and the chlorine atom accepts an additional electron more readily. https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

Chapter 6 | Electronic Structure and Periodic Properties of Elements 333 Figure 6.36 This version of the periodic table displays the electron affinity values (in kJ/mol) for selected elements. The properties discussed in this section (size of atoms and ions, effective nuclear charge, ionization energies, and electron affinities) are central to understanding chemical reactivity. For example, because fluorine has an energetically favorable EA and a large energy barrier to ionization (IE), it is much easier to form fluorine anions than cations. Metallic properties including conductivity and malleability (the ability to be formed into sheets) depend on having electrons that can be removed easily. Thus, metallic character increases as we move down a group and decreases across a period in the same trend observed for atomic size because it is easier to remove an electron that is farther away from the nucleus.

Chapter 6 | Electronic Structure and Periodic Properties of Elements 337 6.1 Electromagnetic Energy × Light and other forms of electromagnetic radiation move through a vacuum with a constant speed, c, of 2.998 108 s−1. m This radiation shows wavelike behavior, which can be characterized by a frequency, ν, and a wavelength, λ, such that c = λν. Light is an example of a travelling wave. Other important wave phenomena include standing waves, periodic oscillations, and vibrations. Standing waves exhibit quantization, since their wavelengths are limited to discrete integer multiples of some characteristic lengths. Electromagnetic radiation that passes through two closely spaced narrow slits having dimensions roughly similar to the wavelength will show an interference pattern that is a result of constructive and destructive interference of the waves. Electromagnetic radiation also demonstrates properties of particles called photons. The energy of a photon is related to the frequency (or alternatively, the hc E = wavelength) of the radiation as E = hν (or ), where h is Planck's constant. That light demonstrates both λ wavelike and particle-like behavior is known as wave-particle duality. All forms of electromagnetic radiation share these properties, although various forms including X-rays, visible light, microwaves, and radio waves interact differently with matter and have very different practical applications. Electromagnetic radiation can be generated by exciting matter to higher energies, such as by heating it. The emitted light can be either continuous (incandescent sources like the sun) or discrete (from specific types of excited atoms). Continuous spectra often have distributions that can be approximated as blackbody radiation at some appropriate temperature. The line spectrum of hydrogen can be obtained by passing the light from an electrified tube of hydrogen gas through a prism. This line spectrum was simple enough that an empirical formula called the Rydberg formula could be derived from the spectrum. Three historically important paradoxes from the late 19th and early 20th centuries that could not be explained within the existing framework of classical mechanics and classical electromagnetism were the blackbody problem, the photoelectric effect, and the discrete spectra of atoms. The resolution of these paradoxes ultimately led to quantum theories that superseded the classical theories. 6.2 The Bohr Model Bohr incorporated Planck’s and Einstein’s quantization ideas into a model of the hydrogen atom that resolved the paradox of atom stability and discrete spectra. The Bohr model of the hydrogen atom explains the connection between the quantization of photons and the quantized emission from atoms. Bohr described the hydrogen atom in terms of an electron moving in a circular orbit about a nucleus. He postulated that the electron was restricted to certain orbits characterized by discrete energies. Transitions between these allowed orbits result in the absorption or emission of photons. When an electron moves from a higher-energy orbit to a more stable one, energy is emitted in the form of a photon. To move an electron from a stable orbit to a more excited one, a photon of energy must be absorbed. Using the Bohr model, we can calculate the energy of an electron and the radius of its orbit in any one-electron system. 6.3 Development of Quantum Theory Macroscopic objects act as particles. Microscopic objects (such as electrons) have properties of both a particle and a wave. Their exact trajectories cannot be determined. The quantum mechanical model of atoms describes the three-dimensional position of the electron in a probabilistic manner according to a mathematical function called a wavefunction, often denoted as ψ. Atomic wavefunctions are also called orbitals. The squared magnitude of the wavefunction describes the distribution of the probability of finding the electron in a particular region in space. Therefore, atomic orbitals describe the areas in an atom where electrons are most likely to be found. An atomic orbital is characterized by three quantum numbers. The principal quantum number, n, can be any positive integer. The general region for value of energy of the orbital and the average distance of an electron from the nucleus are related to n. Orbitals having the same value of n are said to be in the same shell. The angular momentum quantum number, l, can have any integer value from 0 to n – 1. This quantum number describes the shape or type of the orbital. Orbitals with the same principle quantum number and the same l value belong to the same subshell. The magnetic quantum number, ml, with 2l + 1 values ranging from –l to +l, describes the orientation of the orbital in space. In 1 ± 2. addition, each electron has a spin quantum number, ms, that can be equal to No two electrons in the same atom can have the same set of values for all the four quantum numbers.

338 Chapter 6 | Electronic Structure and Periodic Properties of Elements 6.4 Electronic Structure of Atoms (Electron Configurations) The relative energy of the subshells determine the order in which atomic orbitals are filled (1s, 2s, 2p, 3s, 3p, 4s, 3d, 4p, and so on). Electron configurations and orbital diagrams can be determined by applying the Pauli exclusion principle (no two electrons can have the same set of four quantum numbers) and Hund’s rule (whenever possible, electrons retain unpaired spins in degenerate orbitals). Electrons in the outermost orbitals, called valence electrons, are responsible for most of the chemical behavior of elements. In the periodic table, elements with analogous valence electron configurations usually occur within the same group. There are some exceptions to the predicted filling order, particularly when half-filled or completely filled orbitals can be formed. The periodic table can be divided into three categories based on the orbital in which the last electron to be added is placed: main group elements (s and p orbitals), transition elements (d orbitals), and inner transition elements (f orbitals). 6.5 Periodic Variations in Element Properties Electron configurations allow us to understand many periodic trends. Covalent radius increases as we move down a group because the n level (orbital size) increases. Covalent radius mostly decreases as we move left to right across a period because the effective nuclear charge experienced by the electrons increases, and the electrons are pulled in tighter to the nucleus. Anionic radii are larger than the parent atom, while cationic radii are smaller, because the number of valence electrons has changed while the nuclear charge has remained constant. Ionization energy (the energy associated with forming a cation) decreases down a group and mostly increases across a period because it is easier to remove an electron from a larger, higher energy orbital. Electron affinity (the energy associated with forming an anion) is more favorable (exothermic) when electrons are placed into lower energy orbitals, closer to the nucleus. Therefore, electron affinity becomes increasingly negative as we move left to right across the periodic table and decreases as we move down a group. For both IE and electron affinity data, there are exceptions to the trends when dealing with completely filled or half-filled subshells. Exercises 6.1 Electromagnetic Energy 1.

Here they are shown in a ball-and-stick model (left). These molecules have single and double carbon-carbon bonds arranged to form a geometric framework of hexagons and pentagons, similar to the pattern on a soccer ball (center). This unconventional molecular structure is named after architect R.

But it was not until 1985 that a new form of carbon was recognized: buckminsterfullerene, commonly known as a “buckyball.” This molecule was named after the architect and inventor R. Buckminster Fuller (1895–1983), whose signature architectural design was the geodesic dome, characterized by a lattice shell structure supporting a spherical surface. Experimental evidence revealed the formula, C60, and then scientists determined how 60 carbon atoms could form one symmetric, stable molecule. They were guided by bonding theory—the topic of this chapter—which explains how individual atoms connect to form more complex structures.

346 Chapter 7 | Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry 7.1 Ionic Bonding By the end of this section, you will be able to: Explain the formation of cations, anions, and ionic compounds • Predict the charge of common metallic and nonmetallic elements, and write their electron • configurations As you have learned, ions are atoms or molecules bearing an electrical charge. A cation (a positive ion) forms when a neutral atom loses one or more electrons from its valence shell, and an anion (a negative ion) forms when a neutral atom gains one or more electrons in its valence shell. Compounds composed of ions are called ionic compounds (or salts), and their constituent ions are held together by ionic bonds: electrostatic forces of attraction between oppositely charged cations and anions. The properties of ionic compounds shed some light on the nature of ionic bonds. Ionic solids exhibit a crystalline structure and tend to be rigid and brittle; they also tend to have high melting and boiling points, which suggests that ionic bonds are very strong. Ionic solids are also poor conductors of electricity for the same reason—the strength of ionic bonds prevents ions from moving freely in the solid state. Most ionic solids, however, dissolve readily in water. Once dissolved or melted, ionic compounds are excellent conductors of electricity and heat because the ions can move about freely. Neutral atoms and their associated ions have very different physical and chemical properties. Sodium atoms form sodium metal, a soft, silvery-white metal that burns vigorously in air and reacts explosively with water. Chlorine atoms form chlorine gas, Cl2, a yellow-green gas that is extremely corrosive to most metals and very poisonous to animals and plants. The vigorous reaction between the elements sodium and chlorine forms the white, crystalline (Figure 7.2). compound sodium chloride, common table salt, which contains sodium cations and chloride anions The compound composed of these ions exhibits properties entirely different from the properties of the elements sodium and chlorine. Chlorine is poisonous, but sodium chloride is essential to life; sodium atoms react vigorously with water, but sodium chloride simply dissolves in water. Figure 7.2 (a) Sodium is a soft metal that must be stored in mineral oil to prevent reaction with air or water. (b) Chlorine is a pale yellow-green gas. (c) When combined, they form white crystals of sodium chloride (table salt). (credit a: modification of work by “Jurii”/Wikimedia Commons) The Formation of Ionic Compounds Binary ionic compounds are composed of just two elements: a metal (which forms the cations) and a nonmetal (which forms the anions). For example, NaCl is a binary ionic compound. We can think about the formation of such compounds in terms of the periodic properties of the elements. Many metallic elements have relatively low ionization potentials and lose electrons easily. These elements lie to the left in a period or near the bottom of a group on the periodic table. Nonmetal atoms have relatively high electron affinities and thus readily gain electrons lost by metal https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

Chapter 7 | Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry 347 atoms, thereby filling their valence shells. Nonmetallic elements are found in the upper-right corner of the periodic table. As all substances must be electrically neutral, the total number of positive charges on the cations of an ionic compound must equal the total number of negative charges on its anions. The formula of an ionic compound represents the simplest ratio of the numbers of ions necessary to give identical numbers of positive and negative charges. For example, the formula for aluminum oxide, Al2O3, indicates that this ionic compound contains two Al3+, O2−[thus, × × aluminum cations, for every three oxide anions, (2 +3) + (3 –2) = 0]. It is important to note, however, that the formula for an ionic compound does not represent the physical arrangement of its ions. It is incorrect to refer to a sodium chloride (NaCl) “molecule” because there is not a single ionic bond, per se, between any specific pair of sodium and chloride ions. The attractive forces between ions are isotropic—the same in all directions—meaning that any particular ion is equally attracted to all of the nearby ions of opposite charge. This results in the ions arranging themselves into a tightly bound, three-dimensional lattice structure. Sodium chloride, for Na+ Cl– (Figure 7.3). example, consists of a regular arrangement of equal numbers of cations and anions Figure 7.3 The atoms in sodium chloride (common table salt) are arranged to (a) maximize opposite charges interacting. The smaller spheres represent sodium ions, the larger ones represent chloride ions. In the expanded view (b), the geometry can be seen more clearly. Note that each ion is “bonded” to all of the surrounding ions—six in this case. Na+ Cl– The strong electrostatic attraction between and ions holds them tightly together in solid NaCl. It requires 769 Na+ Cl– kJ of energy to dissociate one mole of solid NaCl into separate gaseous and ions: ⟶Na+(g) Cl–(g) NaCl(s) + ΔH = 769 kJ Electronic Structures of Cations When forming a cation, an atom of a main group element tends to lose all of its valence electrons, thus assuming the electronic structure of the noble gas that precedes it in the periodic table. For groups 1 (the alkali metals) and 2 (the alkaline earth metals), the group numbers are equal to the numbers of valence shell electrons and, consequently, to the charges of the cations formed from atoms of these elements when all valence shell electrons are removed. For example, calcium is a group 2 element whose neutral atoms have 20 electrons and a ground state electron 1s22s22p63s23p64s2. configuration of When a Ca atom loses both of its valence electrons, the result is a cation with 1s22s22p63s23p6. Ca2+ 18 electrons, a 2+ charge, and an electron configuration of The ion is therefore isoelectronic with the noble gas Ar. For groups 12–17, the group numbers exceed the number of valence electrons by 10 (accounting for the possibility of full d subshells in atoms of elements in the fourth and greater periods). Thus, the charge of a cation formed by the loss of all valence electrons is equal to the group number minus 10. For example, aluminum (in group 13) forms 3+ (Al3+). ions

348 Chapter 7 | Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry Exceptions to the expected behavior involve elements toward the bottom of the groups. In addition to the expected Tl3+, Sn4+, Pb4+, Bi5+, ions and a partial loss of these atoms’ valence shell electrons can also lead to the formation Tl+, Sn2+, Pb2+, Bi3+ of and ions. The formation of these 1+, 2+, and 3+ cations is ascribed to the inert pair effect, which reflects the relatively low energy of the valence s-electron pair for atoms of the heavy elements of groups 13, 2+ Hg2 (an ion formed 14, and 15. Mercury (group 12) also exhibits an unexpected behavior: it forms a diatomic ion, Hg2+ from two mercury atoms, with an Hg-Hg bond), in addition to the expected monatomic ion (formed from only one mercury atom). Transition and inner transition metal elements behave differently than main group elements. Most transition metal cations have 2+ or 3+ charges that result from the loss of their outermost s electron(s) first, sometimes followed by (1s22s22p63s23p63d64s2) forms the loss of one or two d electrons from the next-to-outermost shell. For example, iron (1s22s22p63s23p63d64s2) Fe3+ (1s22s22p63s23p63d5) Fe2+ by the loss of the 4s electron and the ion by the the ion loss of the 4s electron and one of the 3d electrons. Although the d orbitals of the transition elements are—according to the Aufbau principle—the last to fill when building up electron configurations, the outermost s electrons are the first to be lost when these atoms ionize. When the inner transition metals form ions, they usually have a 3+ charge, resulting from the loss of their outermost s electrons and a d or f electron. Example 7.1 Determining the Electronic Structures of Cations There are at least 14 elements categorized as “essential trace elements” for the human body. They are called “essential” because they are required for healthy bodily functions, “trace” because they are required only in small amounts, and “elements” in spite of the fact that they are really ions. Two of these essential trace Cr3+ Zn2+. elements, chromium and zinc, are required as and Write the electron configurations of these cations. Solution First, write the electron configuration for the neutral atoms: [Ar]3d104s2 Zn: [Ar]3d34s1 Cr: Next, remove electrons from the highest energy orbital. For the transition metals, electrons are removed from the s orbital first and then from the d orbital. For the p-block elements, electrons are removed from the p orbitals and then from the s orbital. Zinc is a member of group 12, so it should have a charge of 2+, and thus loses only the two electrons in its s orbital. Chromium is a transition element and should lose its s electrons and then its d electrons when forming a cation. Thus, we find the following electron configurations of the ions: Zn2+: [Ar]3d10 Cr3+: [Ar]3d3 Check Your Learning Potassium and magnesium are required in our diet.

Chapter 7 | Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry 349 Electronic Structures of Anions Most monatomic anions form when a neutral nonmetal atom gains enough electrons to completely fill its outer s and p orbitals, thereby reaching the electron configuration of the next noble gas. Thus, it is simple to determine the charge on such a negative ion: The charge is equal to the number of electrons that must be gained to fill the s and p orbitals 1s22s22p4, of the parent atom. Oxygen, for example, has the electron configuration whereas the oxygen anion has the 1s22s22p6. electron configuration of the noble gas neon (Ne), The two additional electrons required to fill the valence (O2–). orbitals give the oxide ion the charge of 2– Example 7.2 Determining the Electronic Structure of Anions Selenium and iodine are two essential trace elements that form anions.

But this is not the only way that compounds can be formed. Atoms can also make chemical bonds by sharing electrons equally between each other. Such bonds are called covalent bonds. Covalent bonds are formed between two atoms when both have similar tendencies to attract electrons to themselves (i.e., when both atoms have identical or fairly similar ionization energies and electron affinities). For example, two hydrogen atoms bond covalently to form an H2 molecule; each hydrogen atom in the H2 molecule has two electrons stabilizing it, giving each atom the same number of valence electrons as the noble gas He. Compounds that contain covalent bonds exhibit different physical properties than ionic compounds. Because the attraction between molecules, which are electrically neutral, is weaker than that between electrically charged ions, covalent compounds generally have much lower melting and boiling points than ionic compounds. In fact, many covalent compounds are liquids or gases at room temperature, and, in their solid states, they are typically much softer than ionic solids. Furthermore, whereas ionic compounds are good conductors of electricity when dissolved in water, most covalent compounds are insoluble in water; since they are electrically neutral, they are poor conductors of electricity in any state.

350 Chapter 7 | Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry Formation of Covalent Bonds Nonmetal atoms frequently form covalent bonds with other nonmetal atoms. For example, the hydrogen molecule, Figure 7.4 H2, contains a covalent bond between its two hydrogen atoms. illustrates why this bond is formed. Starting on the far right, we have two separate hydrogen atoms with a particular potential energy, indicated by the red line. Along the x-axis is the distance between the two atoms. As the two atoms approach each other (moving left along the x-axis), their valence orbitals (1s) begin to overlap. The single electrons on each hydrogen atom then interact with both atomic nuclei, occupying the space around both atoms. The strong attraction of each shared electron to both nuclei stabilizes the system, and the potential energy decreases as the bond distance decreases. If the atoms continue to approach each other, the positive charges in the two nuclei begin to repel each other, and the potential energy increases. The bond length is determined by the distance at which the lowest potential energy is achieved. Figure 7.4 The potential energy of two separate hydrogen atoms (right) decreases as they approach each other, and the single electrons on each atom are shared to form a covalent bond. The bond length is the internuclear distance at which the lowest potential energy is achieved. https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

Chapter 7 | Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry 351 It is essential to remember that energy must be added to break chemical bonds (an endothermic process), whereas forming chemical bonds releases energy (an exothermic process). In the case of H2, the covalent bond is very strong; a large amount of energy, 436 kJ, must be added to break the bonds in one mole of hydrogen molecules and cause the atoms to separate: 436 kJ H2(g) ⟶2H(g) ΔH = Conversely, the same amount of energy is released when one mole of H2 molecules forms from two moles of H atoms: 2H(g) ⟶H2(g) ΔH = −436 kJ Pure vs. Polar Covalent Bonds If the atoms that form a covalent bond are identical, as in H2, Cl2, and other diatomic molecules, then the electrons in the bond must be shared equally. We refer to this as a pure covalent bond. Electrons shared in pure covalent bonds have an equal probability of being near each nucleus. In the case of Cl2, each atom starts off with seven valence electrons, and each Cl shares one electron with the other, forming one covalent bond: Cl + Cl ⟶Cl2 The total number of electrons around each individual atom consists of six nonbonding electrons and two shared (i.e., bonding) electrons for eight total electrons, matching the number of valence electrons in the noble gas argon. Since the bonding atoms are identical, Cl2 also features a pure covalent bond. When the atoms linked by a covalent bond are different, the bonding electrons are shared, but no longer equally. Instead, the bonding electrons are more attracted to one atom than the other, giving rise to a shift of electron density toward that atom. This unequal distribution of electrons is known as a polar covalent bond, characterized by a partial positive charge on one atom and a partial negative charge on the other. The atom that attracts the electrons more strongly acquires the partial negative charge and vice versa. For example, the electrons in the H–Cl bond of a hydrogen chloride molecule spend more time near the chlorine atom than near the hydrogen atom. Thus, in an HCl molecule, the chlorine atom carries a partial negative charge and the hydrogen atom has a partial positive charge. Figure 7.5 shows the distribution of electrons in the H–Cl bond. Note that the shaded area around Cl is much larger Figure 7.4, than it is around H. Compare this to which shows the even distribution of electrons in the H2 nonpolar bond. We sometimes designate the positive and negative atoms in a polar covalent bond using a lowercase Greek letter “delta,” δ, with a plus sign or minus sign to indicate whether the atom has a partial positive charge (δ+) or a partial Figure 7.5. negative charge (δ–). This symbolism is shown for the H–Cl molecule in Figure 7.5 (a) The distribution of electron density in the HCl molecule is uneven. The electron density is greater around the chlorine nucleus. The small, black dots indicate the location of the hydrogen and chlorine nuclei in the molecule. (b) Symbols δ+ and δ– indicate the polarity of the H–Cl bond.

352 Chapter 7 | Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry Electronegativity Whether a bond is nonpolar or polar covalent is determined by a property of the bonding atoms called electronegativity. Electronegativity is a measure of the tendency of an atom to attract electrons (or electron density) towards itself. It determines how the shared electrons are distributed between the two atoms in a bond. The more strongly an atom attracts the electrons in its bonds, the larger its electronegativity. Electrons in a polar covalent bond are shifted toward the more electronegative atom; thus, the more electronegative atom is the one with the partial negative charge. The greater the difference in electronegativity, the more polarized the electron distribution and the larger the partial charges of the atoms. Figure 7.6 shows the electronegativity values of the elements as proposed by one of the most famous chemists of (Figure 7.7). the twentieth century: Linus Pauling In general, electronegativity increases from left to right across a period in the periodic table and decreases down a group. Thus, the nonmetals, which lie in the upper right, tend to have the highest electronegativities, with fluorine the most electronegative element of all (EN = 4.0). Metals tend to be less electronegative elements, and the group 1 metals have the lowest electronegativities. Note that noble gases are excluded from this figure because these atoms usually do not share electrons with others atoms since they have a full valence shell. (While noble gas compounds such as XeO2 do exist, they can only be formed under extreme conditions, and thus they do not fit neatly into the general model of electronegativity.) Figure 7.6 The electronegativity values derived by Pauling follow predictable periodic trends with the higher electronegativities toward the upper right of the periodic table. Electronegativity versus Electron Affinity We must be careful not to confuse electronegativity and electron affinity. The electron affinity of an element is a measurable physical quantity, namely, the energy released or absorbed when an isolated gas-phase atom acquires an electron, measured in kJ/mol. Electronegativity, on the other hand, describes how tightly an atom attracts electrons in a bond. It is a dimensionless quantity that is calculated, not measured. Pauling derived the first electronegativity values by comparing the amounts of energy required to break different types of bonds. He chose an arbitrary relative scale ranging from 0 to 4.

Chapter 7 | Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry 353 Linus Pauling Linus Pauling, shown in Figure 7.7, is the only person to have received two unshared (individual) Nobel Prizes: one for chemistry in 1954 for his work on the nature of chemical bonds and one for peace in 1962 for his opposition to weapons of mass destruction. He developed many of the theories and concepts that are foundational to our current understanding of chemistry, including electronegativity and resonance structures. Figure 7.7 Linus Pauling (1901–1994) made many important contributions to the field of chemistry. He was also a prominent activist, publicizing issues related to health and nuclear weapons. Pauling also contributed to many other fields besides chemistry. His research on sickle cell anemia revealed the cause of the disease—the presence of a genetically inherited abnormal protein in the blood—and paved the way for the field of molecular genetics. His work was also pivotal in curbing the testing of nuclear weapons; he proved that radioactive fallout from nuclear testing posed a public health risk. Electronegativity and Bond Type The absolute value of the difference in electronegativity (ΔEN) of two bonded atoms provides a rough measure of the polarity to be expected in the bond and, thus, the bond type. When the difference is very small or zero, the bond is covalent and nonpolar. When it is large, the bond is polar covalent or ionic. The absolute values of the electronegativity differences between the atoms in the bonds H–H, H–Cl, and Na–Cl are 0 (nonpolar), 0.9 (polar covalent), and 2.1 (ionic), respectively. The degree to which electrons are shared between atoms varies from Figure 7.8 completely equal (pure covalent bonding) to not at all (ionic bonding). shows the relationship between electronegativity difference and bond type.

354 Chapter 7 | Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry Figure 7.8 As the electronegativity difference increases between two atoms, the bond becomes more ionic. A rough approximation of the electronegativity differences associated with covalent, polar covalent, and ionic bonds Figure 7.8. is shown in This table is just a general guide, however, with many exceptions. For example, the H and F atoms in HF have an electronegativity difference of 1.9, and the N and H atoms in NH3 a difference of 0.9, yet both of these compounds form bonds that are considered polar covalent. Likewise, the Na and Cl atoms in NaCl have an electronegativity difference of 2.1, and the Mn and I atoms in MnI2 have a difference of 1.0, yet both of these substances form ionic compounds. The best guide to the covalent or ionic character of a bond is to consider the types of atoms involved and their relative positions in the periodic table. Bonds between two nonmetals are generally covalent; bonding between a metal and a nonmetal is often ionic. −, OH–, NO3 Some compounds contain both covalent and ionic bonds. The atoms in polyatomic ions, such as +, NH4 and are held together by polar covalent bonds. However, these polyatomic ions form ionic compounds K+ by combining with ions of opposite charge. For example, potassium nitrate, KNO3, contains the cation and the −anion. NO3 polyatomic Thus, bonding in potassium nitrate is ionic, resulting from the electrostatic attraction −, −.

356 Chapter 7 | Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry explore the typical method for depicting valence shell electrons and chemical bonds, namely Lewis symbols and Lewis structures. Lewis Symbols We use Lewis symbols to describe valence electron configurations of atoms and monatomic ions. A Lewis symbol consists of an elemental symbol surrounded by one dot for each of its valence electrons: Figure 7.9 shows the Lewis symbols for the elements of the third period of the periodic table. Figure 7.9 Lewis symbols illustrating the number of valence electrons for each element in the third period of the periodic table. Lewis symbols can also be used to illustrate the formation of cations from atoms, as shown here for sodium and calcium: Likewise, they can be used to show the formation of anions from atoms, as shown here for chlorine and sulfur: Figure 7.10 demonstrates the use of Lewis symbols to show the transfer of electrons during the formation of ionic compounds. https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

Chapter 7 | Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry 357 Figure 7.10 Cations are formed when atoms lose electrons, represented by fewer Lewis dots, whereas anions are formed by atoms gaining electrons. The total number of electrons does not change. Lewis Structures We also use Lewis symbols to indicate the formation of covalent bonds, which are shown in Lewis structures, drawings that describe the bonding in molecules and polyatomic ions. For example, when two chlorine atoms form a chlorine molecule, they share one pair of electrons: The Lewis structure indicates that each Cl atom has three pairs of electrons that are not used in bonding (called lone pairs) and one shared pair of electrons (written between the atoms). A dash (or line) is sometimes used to indicate a shared pair of electrons: A single shared pair of electrons is called a single bond. Each Cl atom interacts with eight valence electrons: the six in the lone pairs and the two in the single bond. The Octet Rule The other halogen molecules (F2, Br2, I2, and At2) form bonds like those in the chlorine molecule: one single bond between atoms and three lone pairs of electrons per atom. This allows each halogen atom to have a noble gas electron configuration. The tendency of main group atoms to form enough bonds to obtain eight valence electrons is known as the octet rule. The number of bonds that an atom can form can often be predicted from the number of electrons needed to reach an octet (eight valence electrons); this is especially true of the nonmetals of the second period of the periodic table (C, N, O, and F). For example, each atom of a group 14 element has four electrons in its outermost shell and therefore requires four more electrons to reach an octet. These four electrons can be gained by forming four covalent bonds, as

358 Chapter 7 | Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry illustrated here for carbon in CCl4 (carbon tetrachloride) and silicon in SiH4 (silane). Because hydrogen only needs two electrons to fill its valence shell, it is an exception to the octet rule. The transition elements and inner transition elements also do not follow the octet rule: Group 15 elements such as nitrogen have five valence electrons in the atomic Lewis symbol: one lone pair and three unpaired electrons. To obtain an octet, these atoms form three covalent bonds, as in NH3 (ammonia). Oxygen and other atoms in group 16 obtain an octet by forming two covalent bonds: Double and Triple Bonds As previously mentioned, when a pair of atoms shares one pair of electrons, we call this a single bond. However, a pair of atoms may need to share more than one pair of electrons in order to achieve the requisite octet. A double bond forms when two pairs of electrons are shared between a pair of atoms, as between the carbon and oxygen atoms in CH2O (formaldehyde) and between the two carbon atoms in C2H4 (ethylene): A triple bond forms when three electron pairs are shared by a pair of atoms, as in carbon monoxide (CO) and the (CN–): cyanide ion Writing Lewis Structures with the Octet Rule For very simple molecules and molecular ions, we can write the Lewis structures by merely pairing up the unpaired electrons on the constituent atoms.

Answer: How Sciences Interconnect Fullerene Chemistry Carbon soot has been known to man since prehistoric times, but it was not until fairly recently that the molecular structure of the main component of soot was discovered. In 1996, the Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to Richard Smalley (Figure 7.11), Robert Curl, and Harold Kroto for their work in discovering a new form of carbon, the C60 buckminsterfullerene molecule (Figure 7.1). An entire class of compounds, including spheres and tubes of various shapes, were discovered based on C60. This type of molecule, called a fullerene, shows promise in a variety of applications. Because of their size and shape, fullerenes can encapsulate other molecules, so they have shown potential in various applications from hydrogen storage to targeted drug delivery systems. They also possess unique electronic and optical properties that have been put to good use in solar powered devices and chemical sensors. Figure 7.11 Richard Smalley (1943–2005), a professor of physics, chemistry, and astronomy at Rice University, was one of the leading advocates for fullerene chemistry.

Chapter 7 | Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry 363 Exceptions to the Octet Rule Many covalent molecules have central atoms that do not have eight electrons in their Lewis structures. These molecules fall into three categories: Odd-electron molecules have an odd number of valence electrons, and therefore have an unpaired electron. • Electron-deficient molecules have a central atom that has fewer electrons than needed for a noble gas • configuration. Hypervalent molecules have a central atom that has more electrons than needed for a noble gas configuration. • Odd-electron Molecules We call molecules that contain an odd number of electrons free radicals. Nitric oxide, NO, is an example of an odd- electron molecule; it is produced in internal combustion engines when oxygen and nitrogen react at high temperatures. To draw the Lewis structure for an odd-electron molecule like NO, we follow the same six steps we would for other molecules, but with a few minor changes: Determine the total number of valence (outer shell) electrons. The sum of the valence electrons is 5 (from N) 1. + 6 (from O) = 11. The odd number immediately tells us that we have a free radical, so we know that not every atom can have eight electrons in its valence shell. Draw a skeleton structure of the molecule. We can easily draw a skeleton with an N–O single bond: 2. N–O Distribute the remaining electrons as lone pairs on the terminal atoms. In this case, there is no central atom, 3. so we distribute the electrons around both atoms. We give eight electrons to the more electronegative atom in these situations; thus oxygen has the filled valence shell: Place all remaining electrons on the central atom. Since there are no remaining electrons, this step does not 4. apply. Rearrange the electrons to make multiple bonds with the central atom in order to obtain octets wherever 5. possible. We know that an odd-electron molecule cannot have an octet for every atom, but we want to get each atom as close to an octet as possible. In this case, nitrogen has only five electrons around it. To move closer to an octet for nitrogen, we take one of the lone pairs from oxygen and use it to form a NO double bond. (We cannot take another lone pair of electrons on oxygen and form a triple bond because nitrogen would then have nine electrons:) Electron-deficient Molecules We will also encounter a few molecules that contain central atoms that do not have a filled valence shell. Generally, these are molecules with central atoms from groups 2 and 12, outer atoms that are hydrogen, or other atoms that do not form multiple bonds. For example, in the Lewis structures of beryllium dihydride, BeH2, and boron trifluoride, BF3, the beryllium and boron atoms each have only four and six electrons, respectively. It is possible to draw a structure with a double bond between a boron atom and a fluorine atom in BF3, satisfying the octet rule, but experimental evidence indicates the bond lengths are closer to that expected for B–F single bonds. This suggests the best Lewis structure has three B–F single bonds and an electron deficient boron. The reactivity of the compound is also consistent with an electron deficient boron. However, the B–F bonds are slightly shorter than what is actually expected for B–F single bonds, indicating that some double bond character is found in the actual molecule. 

--- Page 372 ---
364 Chapter 7 | Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry An atom like the boron atom in BF3, which does not have eight electrons, is very reactive. It readily combines with a molecule containing an atom with a lone pair of electrons. For example, NH3 reacts with BF3 because the lone pair on nitrogen can be shared with the boron atom: Hypervalent Molecules Elements in the second period of the periodic table (n = 2) can accommodate only eight electrons in their valence shell orbitals because they have only four valence orbitals (one 2s and three 2p orbitals). Elements in the third and higher periods (n ≥3) have more than four valence orbitals and can share more than four pairs of electrons with other atoms because they have empty d orbitals in the same shell. Molecules formed from these elements are sometimes called Figure 7.12 hypervalent molecules. shows the Lewis structures for two hypervalent molecules, PCl5 and SF6. Figure 7.12 In PCl5, the central atom phosphorus shares five pairs of electrons. In SF6, sulfur shares six pairs of electrons. In some hypervalent molecules, such as IF5 and XeF4, some of the electrons in the outer shell of the central atom are lone pairs: When we write the Lewis structures for these molecules, we find that we have electrons left over after filling the valence shells of the outer atoms with eight electrons. These additional electrons must be assigned to the central atom. Example 7.5 Writing Lewis Structures: Octet Rule Violations Xenon is a noble gas, but it forms a number of stable compounds.

Chapter 7 | Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry 365 We can draw the Lewis structure of any covalent molecule by following the six steps discussed earlier. In this case, we can condense the last few steps, since not all of them apply. Calculate the number of valence electrons: Step 1. × XeF2: 8 + (2 7) = 22 × XeF6: 8 + (6 7) = 50 Draw a skeleton joining the atoms by single bonds. Xenon will be the central atom Step 2. because fluorine cannot be a central atom: Distribute the remaining electrons. Step 3. XeF2: We place three lone pairs of electrons around each F atom, accounting for 12 electrons and giving each F atom 8 electrons. Thus, six electrons (three lone pairs) remain. These lone pairs must be placed on the Xe atom. This is acceptable because Xe atoms have empty valence shell d orbitals and can accommodate more than eight electrons. The Lewis structure of XeF2 shows two bonding pairs and three lone pairs of electrons around the Xe atom: XeF6: We place three lone pairs of electrons around each F atom, accounting for 36 electrons. Two electrons remain, and this lone pair is placed on the Xe atom: Check Your Learning The halogens form a class of compounds called the interhalogens, in which halogen atoms covalently bond −.

--- Page 374 ---
366 Chapter 7 | Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry In the previous section, we discussed how to write Lewis structures for molecules and polyatomic ions. As we have seen, however, in some cases, there is seemingly more than one valid structure for a molecule. We can use the concept of formal charges to help us predict the most appropriate Lewis structure when more than one is reasonable. Calculating Formal Charge The formal charge of an atom in a molecule is the hypothetical charge the atom would have if we could redistribute the electrons in the bonds evenly between the atoms. Another way of saying this is that formal charge results when we take the number of valence electrons of a neutral atom, subtract the nonbonding electrons, and then subtract the number of bonds connected to that atom in the Lewis structure. Thus, we calculate formal charge as follows: −1 formal charge = # valence shell electrons (free atom) −# lone pair electrons # bonding electrons 2 We can double-check formal charge calculations by determining the sum of the formal charges for the whole structure. The sum of the formal charges of all atoms in a molecule must be zero; the sum of the formal charges in an ion should equal the charge of the ion. We must remember that the formal charge calculated for an atom is not the actual charge of the atom in the molecule. Formal charge is only a useful bookkeeping procedure; it does not indicate the presence of actual charges. Example 7.6 Calculating Formal Charge from Lewis Structures −. ICl4 Assign formal charges to each atom in the interhalogen ion Solution We divide the bonding electron pairs equally for all I–Cl bonds: Step 1. We assign lone pairs of electrons to their atoms. Each Cl atom now has seven electrons Step 2. assigned to it, and the I atom has eight. Subtract this number from the number of valence electrons for the neutral atom: Step 3. I: 7 – 8 = –1 Cl: 7 – 7 = 0 The sum of the formal charges of all the atoms equals –1, which is identical to the charge of the ion (–1).

Check Your Learning Determine the formal charge for each atom in NCl3. Answer: N: 0; all three Cl atoms: 0 Using Formal Charge to Predict Molecular Structure The arrangement of atoms in a molecule or ion is called its molecular structure. In many cases, following the steps for writing Lewis structures may lead to more than one possible molecular structure—different multiple bond and lone-pair electron placements or different arrangements of atoms, for instance. A few guidelines involving formal charge can be helpful in deciding which of the possible structures is most likely for a particular molecule or ion: A molecular structure in which all formal charges are zero is preferable to one in which some formal charges 1. are not zero. If the Lewis structure must have nonzero formal charges, the arrangement with the smallest nonzero formal 2. charges is preferable. Lewis structures are preferable when adjacent formal charges are zero or of the opposite sign. 3. When we must choose among several Lewis structures with similar distributions of formal charges, the 4. structure with the negative formal charges on the more electronegative atoms is preferable. To see how these guidelines apply, let us consider some possible structures for carbon dioxide, CO2. We know from our previous discussion that the less electronegative atom typically occupies the central position, but formal charges allow us to understand why this occurs. We can draw three possibilities for the structure: carbon in the center and double bonds, carbon in the center with a single and triple bond, and oxygen in the center with double bonds: Comparing the three formal charges, we can definitively identify the structure on the left as preferable because it has only formal charges of zero (Guideline 1). As another example, the thiocyanate ion, an ion formed from a carbon atom, a nitrogen atom, and a sulfur atom, CNS–, NCS–, CSN–. could have three different molecular structures: or The formal charges present in each of these

368 Chapter 7 | Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry molecular structures can help us pick the most likely arrangement of atoms. Possible Lewis structures and the formal charges for each of the three possible structures for the thiocyanate ion are shown here: Note that the sum of the formal charges in each case is equal to the charge of the ion (–1). However, the first arrangement of atoms is preferred because it has the lowest number of atoms with nonzero formal charges (Guideline 2). Also, it places the least electronegative atom in the center, and the negative charge on the more electronegative element (Guideline 4). Example 7.8 Using Formal Charge to Determine Molecular Structure Nitrous oxide, N2O, commonly known as laughing gas, is used as an anesthetic in minor surgeries, such as the routine extraction of wisdom teeth. Which is the likely structure for nitrous oxide? Solution Determining formal charge yields the following: The structure with a terminal oxygen atom best satisfies the criteria for the most stable distribution of formal charge: The number of atoms with formal charges are minimized (Guideline 2), and there is no formal charge larger than one (Guideline 2). This is again consistent with the preference for having the less electronegative atom in the central position.

Chapter 7 | Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry 369 −in NO2 It is not possible to write a single Lewis structure for which nitrogen has an octet and both bonds are equivalent. Instead, we use the concept of resonance: if two or more Lewis structures with the same arrangement of atoms can be written for a molecule or ion, the actual distribution of electrons is an average of that shown by − NO2 the various Lewis structures. The actual distribution of electrons in each of the nitrogen-oxygen bonds in is the average of a double bond and a single bond. We call the individual Lewis structures resonance forms. The actual electronic structure of the molecule (the average of the resonance forms) is called a resonance hybrid of the individual resonance forms. A double-headed arrow between Lewis structures indicates that they are resonance forms. −ion NO2 is shown as: Thus, the electronic structure of the We should remember that a molecule described as a resonance hybrid never possesses an electronic structure described by either resonance form. It does not fluctuate between resonance forms; rather, the actual electronic structure is always the average of that shown by all resonance forms. George Wheland, one of the pioneers of resonance theory, used a historical analogy to describe the relationship between resonance forms and resonance hybrids. A medieval traveler, having never before seen a rhinoceros, described it as a hybrid of a dragon and a unicorn because it had many properties in common with both. Just as a rhinoceros is neither a dragon sometimes nor a unicorn at other times, a resonance hybrid is neither of its resonance forms at any given time. Like a rhinoceros, it is a real entity that experimental evidence has shown to exist. It has some characteristics in common with its resonance forms, but the resonance forms themselves are convenient, imaginary images (like the unicorn and the dragon). 2−, CO3 provides a second example of resonance: The carbonate anion, One oxygen atom must have a double bond to carbon to complete the octet on the central atom. All oxygen atoms, however, are equivalent, and the double bond could form from any one of the three atoms. This gives rise to three resonance forms of the carbonate ion. Because we can write three identical resonance structures, we know that the actual arrangement of electrons in the carbonate ion is the average of the three structures. Again, experiments show that all three C–O bonds are exactly the same.

370 Chapter 7 | Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry 7.5 Strengths of Ionic and Covalent Bonds By the end of this section, you will be able to: Describe the energetics of covalent and ionic bond formation and breakage • Use the Born-Haber cycle to compute lattice energies for ionic compounds • Use average covalent bond energies to estimate enthalpies of reaction • A bond’s strength describes how strongly each atom is joined to another atom, and therefore how much energy is required to break the bond between the two atoms. In this section, you will learn about the bond strength of covalent bonds, and then compare that to the strength of ionic bonds, which is related to the lattice energy of a compound. Bond Strength: Covalent Bonds Stable molecules exist because covalent bonds hold the atoms together. We measure the strength of a covalent bond by the energy required to break it, that is, the energy necessary to separate the bonded atoms. Separating any pair of Figure 7.4). bonded atoms requires energy (see The stronger a bond, the greater the energy required to break it. The energy required to break a specific covalent bond in one mole of gaseous molecules is called the bond energy or the bond dissociation energy. The bond energy for a diatomic molecule, DX–Y, is defined as the standard enthalpy change for the endothermic reaction: XY(g) ⟶X(g) Y(g) + DX−Y = ΔH° For example, the bond energy of the pure covalent H–H bond, DH–H, is 436 kJ per mole of H–H bonds broken: ⟶2H(g) H2(g) DH−H = ΔH° = 436 kJ Molecules with three or more atoms have two or more bonds. The sum of all bond energies in such a molecule is equal to the standard enthalpy change for the endothermic reaction that breaks all the bonds in the molecule. For example, the sum of the four C–H bond energies in CH4, 1660 kJ, is equal to the standard enthalpy change of the reaction: The average C–H bond energy, DC–H, is 1660/4 = 415 kJ/mol because there are four moles of C–H bonds broken per mole of the reaction. Although the four C–H bonds are equivalent in the original molecule, they do not each require the same energy to break; once the first bond is broken (which requires 439 kJ/mol), the remaining bonds are easier to break. The 415 kJ/mol value is the average, not the exact value required to break any one bond. The strength of a bond between two atoms increases as the number of electron pairs in the bond increases. Generally, as the bond strength increases, the bond length decreases. Thus, we find that triple bonds are stronger and shorter than double bonds between the same two atoms; likewise, double bonds are stronger and shorter than single bonds Table 7.2, between the same two atoms. Average bond energies for some common bonds appear in and a comparison Table 7.3. of bond lengths and bond strengths for some common bonds appears in When one atom bonds to various atoms in a group, the bond strength typically decreases as we move down the group. For example, C–F is 439 kJ/mol, C–Cl is 330 kJ/mol, and C–Br is 275 kJ/mol. https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

Calculations of this type will also tell us whether a reaction is exothermic or endothermic. An exothermic reaction (ΔH negative, heat produced) results when the bonds in the products are stronger than the bonds in the reactants. An endothermic reaction (ΔH positive, heat absorbed) results when the bonds in the products are weaker than those in the reactants. The enthalpy change, ΔH, for a chemical reaction is approximately equal to the sum of the energy required to break all bonds in the reactants (energy “in”, positive sign) plus the energy released when all bonds are formed in the products (energy “out,” negative sign). This can be expressed mathematically in the following way: ΔH = ƩD −ƩD bonds broken bonds formed Ʃ In this expression, the symbol means “the sum of” and D represents the bond energy in kilojoules per mole, which Table 7.3) is always a positive number. The bond energy is obtained from a table (like and will depend on whether the particular bond is a single, double, or triple bond. Thus, in calculating enthalpies in this manner, it is important that we consider the bonding in all reactants and products. Because D values are typically averages for one type of bond in many different molecules, this calculation provides a rough estimate, not an exact value, for the enthalpy of reaction. Consider the following reaction: ⟶2HCl(g) H2(g) + Cl2(g) or H–H(g) Cl–Cl(g) ⟶2H–Cl(g) + To form two moles of HCl, one mole of H–H bonds and one mole of Cl–Cl bonds must be broken. The energy required to break these bonds is the sum of the bond energy of the H–H bond (436 kJ/mol) and the Cl–Cl bond (243 × kJ/mol). During the reaction, two moles of H–Cl bonds are formed (bond energy = 432 kJ/mol), releasing 2 432 kJ; or 864 kJ. Because the bonds in the products are stronger than those in the reactants, the reaction releases more energy than it consumes: https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

Twice that value is –184.6 kJ, which agrees well with the answer obtained earlier for the formation of two moles of HCl. Example 7.9 Using Bond Energies to Calculate Approximate Enthalpy Changes Methanol, CH3OH, may be an excellent alternative fuel. The high-temperature reaction of steam and carbon produces a mixture of the gases carbon monoxide, CO, and hydrogen, H2, from which methanol can be Table 7.3, produced. Using the bond energies in calculate the approximate enthalpy change, ΔH, for the reaction here: CO(g) OH(g) + 2H2(g) ⟶CH3 Solution First, we need to write the Lewis structures of the reactants and the products: From this, we see that ΔH for this reaction involves the energy required to break a C–O triple bond and two H–H single bonds, as well as the energy produced by the formation of three C–H single bonds, a C–O single bond, and an O–H single bond.

Answer: –35 kJ Ionic Bond Strength and Lattice Energy An ionic compound is stable because of the electrostatic attraction between its positive and negative ions. The lattice energy of a compound is a measure of the strength of this attraction. The lattice energy (ΔHlattice) of an ionic compound is defined as the energy required to separate one mole of the solid into its component gaseous ions. For the ionic solid MX, the lattice energy is the enthalpy change of the process: ⟶Mn+(g) Xn−(g) MX(s) ΔHlattice + Note that we are using the convention where the ionic solid is separated into ions, so our lattice energies will be endothermic (positive values). Some texts use the equivalent but opposite convention, defining lattice energy as the energy released when separate ions combine to form a lattice and giving negative (exothermic) values. Thus, if you are looking up lattice energies in another reference, be certain to check which definition is being used. In both cases, a larger magnitude for lattice energy indicates a more stable ionic compound. For sodium chloride, ΔHlattice = 769 kJ. Na+ Cl– Thus, it requires 769 kJ to separate one mole of solid NaCl into gaseous and ions. When one mole each of Na+ Cl– gaseous and ions form solid NaCl, 769 kJ of heat is released. The lattice energy ΔHlattice of an ionic crystal can be expressed by the following equation (derived from Coulomb’s law, governing the forces between electric charges): C(Z+)(Z−) ΔHlattice = Ro Z+ Z– in which C is a constant that depends on the type of crystal structure; and are the charges on the ions; and Ro is the interionic distance (the sum of the radii of the positive and negative ions). Thus, the lattice energy of an ionic crystal increases rapidly as the charges of the ions increase and the sizes of the ions decrease. When all other parameters are kept constant, doubling the charge of both the cation and anion quadruples the lattice energy. For (Z+ Z– (Z+ Z– example, the lattice energy of LiF and = 1) is 1023 kJ/mol, whereas that of MgO and = 2) is 3900 kJ/ mol (Ro is nearly the same—about 200 pm for both compounds). Different interatomic distances produce different lattice energies. For example, we can compare the lattice energy of MgF2 (2957 kJ/mol) to that of MgI2 (2327 kJ/mol) to observe the effect on lattice energy of the smaller ionic size of F– I–. as compared to Example 7.10 Lattice Energy Comparisons Cr3+.

The ion is smaller than the ion. Thus, Al2O3 would have a shorter interionic distance than Al2Se3, and Al2O3 would have the larger lattice energy. Check Your Learning Zinc oxide, ZnO, is a very effective sunscreen. How would the lattice energy of ZnO compare to that of NaCl? Answer: ZnO would have the larger lattice energy because the Z values of both the cation and the anion in ZnO are greater, and the interionic distance of ZnO is smaller than that of NaCl. The Born-Haber Cycle It is not possible to measure lattice energies directly. However, the lattice energy can be calculated using the equation given in the previous section or by using a thermochemical cycle. The Born-Haber cycle is an application of Hess’s law that breaks down the formation of an ionic solid into a series of individual steps: ΔHf° , the standard enthalpy of formation of the compound • IE, the ionization energy of the metal • EA, the electron affinity of the nonmetal • ΔHs° , the enthalpy of sublimation of the metal • D, the bond dissociation energy of the nonmetal • ΔHlattice, the lattice energy of the compound • Figure 7.13 diagrams the Born-Haber cycle for the formation of solid cesium fluoride. Figure 7.13 The Born-Haber cycle shows the relative energies of each step involved in the formation of an ionic solid from the necessary elements in their reference states. ΔHs° We begin with the elements in their most common states, Cs(s) and F2(g). The represents the conversion of solid cesium into a gas, and then the ionization energy converts the gaseous cesium atoms into cations. In the next step, we account for the energy required to break the F–F bond to produce fluorine atoms. Converting one mole of 

--- Page 384 ---
376 Chapter 7 | Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry fluorine atoms into fluoride ions is an exothermic process, so this step gives off energy (the electron affinity) and is shown as decreasing along the y-axis. We now have one mole of Cs cations and one mole of F anions. These ions combine to produce solid cesium fluoride. The enthalpy change in this step is the negative of the lattice energy, so it is also an exothermic quantity. The total energy involved in this conversion is equal to the experimentally determined ΔHf° , enthalpy of formation, of the compound from its elements. In this case, the overall change is exothermic. Hess’s law can also be used to show the relationship between the enthalpies of the individual steps and the enthalpy Table 7.4 of formation. shows this for cesium chloride, CsCl2.

For cesium chloride, using this data, the lattice energy is: ΔHlattice = (411 + 109 + 122 + 496 + 368) kJ = 770 kJ The Born-Haber cycle may also be used to calculate any one of the other quantities in the equation for lattice energy, ΔHs° , provided that the remainder is known. For example, if the relevant enthalpy of sublimation ionization energy ΔHf° are known, (IE), bond dissociation enthalpy (D), lattice energy ΔHlattice, and standard enthalpy of formation the Born-Haber cycle can be used to determine the electron affinity of an atom. Lattice energies calculated for ionic compounds are typically much higher than bond dissociation energies measured for covalent bonds. Whereas lattice energies typically fall in the range of 600–4000 kJ/mol (some even higher), covalent bond dissociation energies are typically between 150–400 kJ/mol for single bonds. Keep in mind, however, that these are not directly comparable values. For ionic compounds, lattice energies are associated with many interactions, as cations and anions pack together in an extended lattice. For covalent bonds, the bond dissociation energy is associated with the interaction of just two atoms. https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

Chapter 7 | Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry 377 7.6 Molecular Structure and Polarity By the end of this section, you will be able to: Predict the structures of small molecules using valence shell electron pair repulsion (VSEPR) theory • Explain the concepts of polar covalent bonds and molecular polarity • Assess the polarity of a molecule based on its bonding and structure • Thus far, we have used two-dimensional Lewis structures to represent molecules. However, molecular structure is actually three-dimensional, and it is important to be able to describe molecular bonds in terms of their distances, (Figure 7.14). angles, and relative arrangements in space A bond angle is the angle between any two bonds that include a common atom, usually measured in degrees. A bond distance (or bond length) is the distance between the nuclei of two bonded atoms along the straight line joining the nuclei. Bond distances are measured in Ångstroms (1 10–10 10–12 Å = m) or picometers (1 pm = m, 100 pm = 1 Å). Figure 7.14 Bond distances (lengths) and angles are shown for the formaldehyde molecule, H2CO. VSEPR Theory Valence shell electron-pair repulsion theory (VSEPR theory) enables us to predict the molecular structure, including approximate bond angles around a central atom, of a molecule from an examination of the number of bonds and lone electron pairs in its Lewis structure. The VSEPR model assumes that electron pairs in the valence shell of a central atom will adopt an arrangement that minimizes repulsions between these electron pairs by maximizing the distance between them. The electrons in the valence shell of a central atom form either bonding pairs of electrons, located primarily between bonded atoms, or lone pairs. The electrostatic repulsion of these electrons is reduced when the various regions of high electron density assume positions as far from each other as possible. VSEPR theory predicts the arrangement of electron pairs around each central atom and, usually, the correct arrangement of atoms in a molecule. We should understand, however, that the theory only considers electron-pair repulsions. Other interactions, such as nuclear-nuclear repulsions and nuclear-electron attractions, are also involved in the final arrangement that atoms adopt in a particular molecular structure. As a simple example of VSEPR theory, let us predict the structure of a gaseous BeF2 molecule. The Lewis structure (Figure 7.15) of BeF2 shows only two electron pairs around the central beryllium atom. With two bonds and no lone pairs of electrons on the central atom, the bonds are as far apart as possible, and the electrostatic repulsion between these regions of high electron density is reduced to a minimum when they are on opposite sides of the central atom. (Figure 7.15). The bond angle is 180° 

--- Page 386 ---
378 Chapter 7 | Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry Figure 7.15 The BeF2 molecule adopts a linear structure in which the two bonds are as far apart as possible, on opposite sides of the Be atom. Figure 7.16 illustrates this and other electron-pair geometries that minimize the repulsions among regions of high electron density (bonds and/or lone pairs). Two regions of electron density around a central atom in a molecule form a linear geometry; three regions form a trigonal planar geometry; four regions form a tetrahedral geometry; five regions form a trigonal bipyramidal geometry; and six regions form an octahedral geometry.

Chapter 7 | Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry 379 Electron-pair Geometry versus Molecular Structure It is important to note that electron-pair geometry around a central atom is not the same thing as its molecular Figure 7.16 structure. The electron-pair geometries shown in describe all regions where electrons are located, bonds as well as lone pairs. Molecular structure describes the location of the atoms, not the electrons. We differentiate between these two situations by naming the geometry that includes all electron pairs the electron- pair geometry. The structure that includes only the placement of the atoms in the molecule is called the molecular structure. The electron-pair geometries will be the same as the molecular structures when there are no lone electron pairs around the central atom, but they will be different when there are lone pairs present on the central atom. For example, the methane molecule, CH4, which is the major component of natural gas, has four bonding pairs of electrons around the central carbon atom; the electron-pair geometry is tetrahedral, as is the molecular structure (Figure 7.17). On the other hand, the ammonia molecule, NH3, also has four electron pairs associated with the nitrogen atom, and thus has a tetrahedral electron-pair geometry. One of these regions, however, is a lone pair, which (Figure 7.18). is not included in the molecular structure, and this lone pair influences the shape of the molecule Figure 7.17 The molecular structure of the methane molecule, CH4, is shown with a tetrahedral arrangement of the hydrogen atoms. VSEPR structures like this one are often drawn using the wedge and dash notation, in which solid lines represent bonds in the plane of the page, solid wedges represent bonds coming up out of the plane, and dashed lines represent bonds going down into the plane. Figure 7.18 (a) The electron-pair geometry for the ammonia molecule is tetrahedral with one lone pair and three single bonds. (b) The trigonal pyramidal molecular structure is determined from the electron-pair geometry. (c) The actual bond angles deviate slightly from the idealized angles because the lone pair takes up a larger region of space than do the single bonds, causing the HNH angle to be slightly smaller than 109.5°. Figure 7.18, Figure 7.16 As seen in small distortions from the ideal angles in can result from differences in repulsion between various regions of electron density. VSEPR theory predicts these distortions by establishing an order of repulsions and an order of the amount of space occupied by different kinds of electron pairs. The order of electron-pair repulsions from greatest to least repulsion is: lone pair-lone pair > lone pair-bonding pair > bonding pair-bonding pair This order of repulsions determines the amount of space occupied by different regions of electrons. A lone pair of electrons occupies a larger region of space than the electrons in a triple bond; in turn, electrons in a triple bond occupy more space than those in a double bond, and so on. The order of sizes from largest to smallest is: lone pair > triple bond > double bond > single bond

380 Chapter 7 | Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry (Figure Consider formaldehyde, H2CO, which is used as a preservative for biological and anatomical specimens 7.14). This molecule has regions of high electron density that consist of two single bonds and one double bond. The basic geometry is trigonal planar with 120° bond angles, but we see that the double bond causes slightly larger angles (121°), and the angle between the single bonds is slightly smaller (118°). In the ammonia molecule, the three hydrogen atoms attached to the central nitrogen are not arranged in a flat, trigonal (Figure 7.18) planar molecular structure, but rather in a three-dimensional trigonal pyramid with the nitrogen atom at the apex and the three hydrogen atoms forming the base. The ideal bond angles in a trigonal pyramid are based on the tetrahedral electron pair geometry. Again, there are slight deviations from the ideal because lone pairs occupy larger regions of space than do bonding electrons. The H–N–H bond angles in NH3 are slightly smaller than the (Figure 7.16) 109.5° angle in a regular tetrahedron because the lone pair-bonding pair repulsion is greater than the (Figure 7.18). Figure 7.19 bonding pair-bonding pair repulsion illustrates the ideal molecular structures, which are predicted based on the electron-pair geometries for various combinations of lone pairs and bonding pairs. Figure 7.19 The molecular structures are identical to the electron-pair geometries when there are no lone pairs present (first column). For a particular number of electron pairs (row), the molecular structures for one or more lone pairs are determined based on modifications of the corresponding electron-pair geometry.

Chapter 7 | Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry 381 X is replaced with a lone pair because the molecules can be rotated to convert positions. For trigonal bipyramidal Figure 7.20: electron-pair geometries, however, there are two distinct X positions, as shown in an axial position (if we hold a model of a trigonal bipyramid by the two axial positions, we have an axis around which we can rotate the model) and an equatorial position (three positions form an equator around the middle of the molecule). As shown in Figure 7.19, the axial position is surrounded by bond angles of 90°, whereas the equatorial position has more space available because of the 120° bond angles. In a trigonal bipyramidal electron-pair geometry, lone pairs always occupy equatorial positions because these more spacious positions can more easily accommodate the larger lone pairs. Theoretically, we can come up with three possible arrangements for the three bonds and two lone pairs for the ClF3 (Figure 7.20). molecule The stable structure is the one that puts the lone pairs in equatorial locations, giving a T- shaped molecular structure. Figure 7.20 (a) In a trigonal bipyramid, the two axial positions are located directly across from one another, whereas the three equatorial positions are located in a triangular arrangement. (b–d) The two lone pairs (red lines) in ClF3 have several possible arrangements, but the T-shaped molecular structure (b) is the one actually observed, consistent with the larger lone pairs both occupying equatorial positions. When a central atom has two lone electron pairs and four bonding regions, we have an octahedral electron-pair geometry. The two lone pairs are on opposite sides of the octahedron (180° apart), giving a square planar molecular (Figure 7.19). structure that minimizes lone pair-lone pair repulsions Predicting Electron Pair Geometry and Molecular Structure The following procedure uses VSEPR theory to determine the electron pair geometries and the molecular structures: Write the Lewis structure of the molecule or polyatomic ion. 1. Count the number of regions of electron density (lone pairs and bonds) around the central atom. A single, 2. double, or triple bond counts as one region of electron density. Identify the electron-pair geometry based on the number of regions of electron density: linear, trigonal planar, 3. (Figure 7.19, tetrahedral, trigonal bipyramidal, or octahedral first column). (Figure 7.19). Use the number of lone pairs to determine the molecular structure If more than one 4. arrangement of lone pairs and chemical bonds is possible, choose the one that will minimize repulsions, remembering that lone pairs occupy more space than multiple bonds, which occupy more space than single bonds. In trigonal bipyramidal arrangements, repulsion is minimized when every lone pair is in an equatorial position. In an octahedral arrangement with two lone pairs, repulsion is minimized when the lone pairs are on opposite sides of the central atom. The following examples illustrate the use of VSEPR theory to predict the molecular structure of molecules or ions that have no lone pairs of electrons. In this case, the molecular structure is identical to the electron pair geometry. Example 7.11

The electron-pair geometry and molecular structure are identical, and CO2 molecules are linear. (b) We write the Lewis structure of BCl3 as: Thus we see that BCl3 contains three bonds, and there are no lone pairs of electrons on boron. The arrangement of three regions of high electron density gives a trigonal planar electron-pair geometry. The B–Cl bonds lie in a plane with 120° angles between them. BCl3 also has a trigonal planar molecular (Figure 7.21). structure Figure 7.21 The electron-pair geometry and molecular structure of BCl3 are both trigonal planar.

XeOF4 is a molecule that adopts this structure. Molecular Polarity and Dipole Moment As discussed previously, polar covalent bonds connect two atoms with differing electronegativities, leaving one atom with a partial positive charge (δ+) and the other atom with a partial negative charge (δ–), as the electrons are pulled toward the more electronegative atom. This separation of charge gives rise to a bond dipole moment. The magnitude of a bond dipole moment is represented by the Greek letter mu (µ) and is given by the formula shown here, where Q is the magnitude of the partial charges (determined by the electronegativity difference) and r is the distance between the charges: µ = Qr (Figure 7.26). This bond moment can be represented as a vector, a quantity having both direction and magnitude Dipole vectors are shown as arrows pointing along the bond from the less electronegative atom toward the more electronegative atom. A small plus sign is drawn on the less electronegative end to indicate the partially positive end of the bond. The length of the arrow is proportional to the magnitude of the electronegativity difference between the two atoms. Figure 7.26 (a) There is a small difference in electronegativity between C and H, represented as a short vector. (b) The electronegativity difference between B and F is much larger, so the vector representing the bond moment is much longer. A whole molecule may also have a separation of charge, depending on its molecular structure and the polarity of each of its bonds. If such a charge separation exists, the molecule is said to be a polar molecule (or dipole); otherwise the molecule is said to be nonpolar. The dipole moment measures the extent of net charge separation in the molecule as a whole. We determine the dipole moment by adding the bond moments in three-dimensional space, taking into account the molecular structure. For diatomic molecules, there is only one bond, so its bond dipole moment determines the molecular polarity. Homonuclear diatomic molecules such as Br2 and N2 have no difference in electronegativity, so their dipole moment is zero. For heteronuclear molecules such as CO, there is a small dipole moment. For HF, there is a larger dipole moment because there is a larger difference in electronegativity. When a molecule contains more than one bond, the geometry must be taken into account. If the bonds in a molecule are arranged such that their bond moments cancel (vector sum equals zero), then the molecule is nonpolar. This is the (Figure 7.27). situation in CO2 Each of the bonds is polar, but the molecule as a whole is nonpolar. From the Lewis structure, and using VSEPR theory, we determine that the CO2 molecule is linear with polar C=O bonds on opposite sides of the carbon atom. The bond moments cancel because they are pointed in opposite directions. In the case of the https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

Chapter 7 | Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry 389 (Figure 7.27), water molecule the Lewis structure again shows that there are two bonds to a central atom, and the electronegativity difference again shows that each of these bonds has a nonzero bond moment. In this case, however, the molecular structure is bent because of the lone pairs on O, and the two bond moments do not cancel. Therefore, water does have a net dipole moment and is a polar molecule (dipole). Figure 7.27 The overall dipole moment of a molecule depends on the individual bond dipole moments and how they are arranged. (a) Each CO bond has a bond dipole moment, but they point in opposite directions so that the net CO2 molecule is nonpolar. (b) In contrast, water is polar because the OH bond moments do not cancel out. The OCS molecule has a structure similar to CO2, but a sulfur atom has replaced one of the oxygen atoms. To determine if this molecule is polar, we draw the molecular structure. VSEPR theory predicts a linear molecule: Figure 7.6, Although the C–O bond is polar, C and S have the same electronegativity values as shown in so there is no C–S dipole. Thus, the two bonds do not have of the same bond dipole moment, and the bond moments do not cancel. Because oxygen is more electronegative than sulfur, the oxygen end of the molecule is the negative end. Chloromethane, CH3Cl, is another example of a polar molecule. Although the polar C–Cl and C–H bonds are arranged in a tetrahedral geometry, the C–Cl bonds have a larger bond moment than the C–H bond, and the bond moments do not completely cancel each other. All of the dipoles have a downward component in the orientation shown, since carbon is more electronegative than hydrogen and less electronegative than chlorine: When we examine the highly symmetrical molecules BF3 (trigonal planar), CH4 (tetrahedral), PF5 (trigonal bipyramidal), and SF6 (octahedral), in which all the polar bonds are identical, the molecules are nonpolar. The bonds in these molecules are arranged such that their dipoles cancel. However, just because a molecule contains identical bonds does not mean that the dipoles will always cancel. Many molecules that have identical bonds and lone pairs on the central atoms have bond dipoles that do not cancel. Examples include H2S and NH3. A hydrogen atom is at the positive end and a nitrogen or sulfur atom is at the negative end of the polar bonds in these molecules:

390 Chapter 7 | Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry To summarize, to be polar, a molecule must: Contain at least one polar covalent bond. 1. Have a molecular structure such that the sum of the vectors of each bond dipole moment does not cancel. 2. Properties of Polar Molecules Polar molecules tend to align when placed in an electric field with the positive end of the molecule oriented toward (Figure 7.28). the negative plate and the negative end toward the positive plate We can use an electrically charged object to attract polar molecules, but nonpolar molecules are not attracted. Also, polar solvents are better at dissolving polar substances, and nonpolar solvents are better at dissolving nonpolar substances. Figure 7.28 (a) Molecules are always randomly distributed in the liquid state in the absence of an electric field. (b) When an electric field is applied, polar molecules like HF will align to the dipoles with the field direction.

This should display a molecule ABC with three electronegativity adjustors. You can display or hide the bond moments, molecular dipoles, and partial charges at the right. Turning on the Electric Field will show whether the molecule moves when exposed to a field, similar to Figure 7.28. Use the electronegativity controls to determine how the molecular dipole will look for the starting bent molecule if: (a) A and C are very electronegative and B is in the middle of the range. (b) A is very electronegative, and B and C are not. Solution (a) Molecular dipole moment points immediately between A and C. (b) Molecular dipole moment points along the A–B bond, toward A. Check Your Learning Determine the partial charges that will give the largest possible bond dipoles. Answer: The largest bond moments will occur with the largest partial charges. The two solutions above represent how unevenly the electrons are shared in the bond. The bond moments will be maximized when the electronegativity difference is greatest. The controls for A and C should be set to one extreme, and B should be set to the opposite extreme. Although the magnitude of the bond moment will not change based on whether B is the most electronegative or the least, the direction of the bond moment will.

394 Chapter 7 | Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry Summary 7.1 Ionic Bonding Atoms gain or lose electrons to form ions with particularly stable electron configurations. The charges of cations formed by the representative metals may be determined readily because, with few exceptions, the electronic structures of these ions have either a noble gas configuration or a completely filled electron shell. The charges of anions formed by the nonmetals may also be readily determined because these ions form when nonmetal atoms gain enough electrons to fill their valence shells. 7.2 Covalent Bonding Covalent bonds form when electrons are shared between atoms and are attracted by the nuclei of both atoms. In pure covalent bonds, the electrons are shared equally. In polar covalent bonds, the electrons are shared unequally, as one atom exerts a stronger force of attraction on the electrons than the other. The ability of an atom to attract a pair of electrons in a chemical bond is called its electronegativity. The difference in electronegativity between two atoms determines how polar a bond will be. In a diatomic molecule with two identical atoms, there is no difference in electronegativity, so the bond is nonpolar or pure covalent. When the electronegativity difference is very large, as is the case between metals and nonmetals, the bonding is characterized as ionic. 7.3 Lewis Symbols and Structures Valence electronic structures can be visualized by drawing Lewis symbols (for atoms and monatomic ions) and Lewis structures (for molecules and polyatomic ions). Lone pairs, unpaired electrons, and single, double, or triple bonds are used to indicate where the valence electrons are located around each atom in a Lewis structure. Most structures—especially those containing second row elements—obey the octet rule, in which every atom (except H) is surrounded by eight electrons. Exceptions to the octet rule occur for odd-electron molecules (free radicals), electron- deficient molecules, and hypervalent molecules. 7.4 Formal Charges and Resonance In a Lewis structure, formal charges can be assigned to each atom by treating each bond as if one-half of the electrons are assigned to each atom. These hypothetical formal charges are a guide to determining the most appropriate Lewis structure. A structure in which the formal charges are as close to zero as possible is preferred. Resonance occurs in cases where two or more Lewis structures with identical arrangements of atoms but different distributions of electrons can be written. The actual distribution of electrons (the resonance hybrid) is an average of the distribution indicated by the individual Lewis structures (the resonance forms). 7.5 Strengths of Ionic and Covalent Bonds The strength of a covalent bond is measured by its bond dissociation energy, that is, the amount of energy required to break that particular bond in a mole of molecules. Multiple bonds are stronger than single bonds between the same atoms. The enthalpy of a reaction can be estimated based on the energy input required to break bonds and the energy released when new bonds are formed. For ionic bonds, the lattice energy is the energy required to separate one mole of a compound into its gas phase ions. Lattice energy increases for ions with higher charges and shorter distances between ions. Lattice energies are often calculated using the Born-Haber cycle, a thermochemical cycle including all of the energetic steps involved in converting elements into an ionic compound. 7.6 Molecular Structure and Polarity VSEPR theory predicts the three-dimensional arrangement of atoms in a molecule. It states that valence electrons will assume an electron-pair geometry that minimizes repulsions between areas of high electron density (bonds and/ or lone pairs). Molecular structure, which refers only to the placement of atoms in a molecule and not the electrons, is equivalent to electron-pair geometry only when there are no lone electron pairs around the central atom. A dipole moment measures a separation of charge. For one bond, the bond dipole moment is determined by the difference in electronegativity between the two atoms. For a molecule, the overall dipole moment is determined by both the https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

Chapter 8 | Advanced Theories of Covalent Bonding 413 Chapter 8 Advanced Theories of Covalent Bonding Figure 8.1 Oxygen molecules orient randomly most of the time, as shown in the top magnified view. However, when we pour liquid oxygen through a magnet, the molecules line up with the magnetic field, and the attraction allows them to stay suspended between the poles of the magnet where the magnetic field is strongest. Other diatomic molecules (like N2) flow past the magnet. The detailed explanation of bonding described in this chapter allows us to understand this phenomenon. (credit: modification of work by Jefferson Lab) Chapter Outline 8.1 Valence Bond Theory 8.2 Hybrid Atomic Orbitals 8.3 Multiple Bonds 8.4 Molecular Orbital Theory Introduction We have examined the basic ideas of bonding, showing that atoms share electrons to form molecules with stable Lewis structures and that we can predict the shapes of those molecules by valence shell electron pair repulsion (VSEPR) theory. These ideas provide an important starting point for understanding chemical bonding. But these models sometimes fall short in their abilities to predict the behavior of real substances. How can we reconcile the geometries of s, p, and d atomic orbitals with molecular shapes that show angles like 120° and 109.5°? Furthermore, we know that electrons and magnetic behavior are related through electromagnetic fields. Both N2 and O2 have fairly similar Lewis structures that contain lone pairs of electrons. Yet oxygen demonstrates very different magnetic behavior than nitrogen. We can pour liquid nitrogen through a Figure 8.1) magnetic field with no visible interactions, while liquid oxygen (shown in is attracted to the magnet

414 Chapter 8 | Advanced Theories of Covalent Bonding and floats in the magnetic field. We need to understand the additional concepts of valence bond theory, orbital hybridization, and molecular orbital theory to understand these observations. 8.1 Valence Bond Theory By the end of this section, you will be able to: Describe the formation of covalent bonds in terms of atomic orbital overlap • Define and give examples of σ and π bonds • As we know, a scientific theory is a strongly supported explanation for observed natural laws or large bodies of experimental data. For a theory to be accepted, it must explain experimental data and be able to predict behavior. For example, VSEPR theory has gained widespread acceptance because it predicts three-dimensional molecular shapes that are consistent with experimental data collected for thousands of different molecules. However, VSEPR theory does not provide an explanation of chemical bonding. There are successful theories that describe the electronic structure of atoms. We can use quantum mechanics to predict the specific regions around an atom where electrons are likely to be located: A spherical shape for an s orbital, a dumbbell shape for a p orbital, and so forth. However, these predictions only describe the orbitals around free atoms. When atoms bond to form molecules, atomic orbitals are not sufficient to describe the regions where electrons will be located in the molecule. A more complete understanding of electron distributions requires a model that can account for the electronic structure of molecules. One popular theory holds that a covalent bond forms when a pair of electrons is shared by two atoms and is simultaneously attracted by the nuclei of both atoms. In the following sections, we will discuss how such bonds are described by valence bond theory and hybridization. Valence bond theory describes a covalent bond as the overlap of half-filled atomic orbitals (each containing a single electron) that yield a pair of electrons shared between the two bonded atoms. We say that orbitals on two different atoms overlap when a portion of one orbital and a portion of a second orbital occupy the same region of space. According to valence bond theory, a covalent bond results when two conditions are met: (1) an orbital on one atom overlaps an orbital on a second atom and (2) the single electrons in each orbital combine to form an electron pair. The mutual attraction between this negatively charged electron pair and the two atoms’ positively charged nuclei serves to physically link the two atoms through a force we define as a covalent bond. The strength of a covalent bond depends on the extent of overlap of the orbitals involved. Orbitals that overlap extensively form bonds that are stronger than those that have less overlap. Figure 8.2 The energy of the system depends on how much the orbitals overlap. illustrates how the sum of the energies of two hydrogen atoms (the colored curve) changes as they approach each other. When the atoms are far apart there is no overlap, and by convention we set the sum of the energies at zero. As the atoms move together, their orbitals begin to overlap. Each electron begins to feel the attraction of the nucleus in the other atom. In addition, the electrons begin to repel each other, as do the nuclei. While the atoms are still widely separated, the attractions are slightly stronger than the repulsions, and the energy of the system decreases. (A bond begins to form.) As the atoms move closer together, the overlap increases, so the attraction of the nuclei for the electrons continues to increase (as do the repulsions among electrons and between the nuclei). At some specific distance between the atoms, which varies depending on the atoms involved, the energy reaches its lowest (most stable) value. This optimum distance between the two bonded nuclei is the bond distance between the two atoms. The bond is stable because at this point, the attractive and repulsive forces combine to create the lowest possible energy configuration. If the distance between the nuclei were to decrease further, the repulsions between nuclei and the repulsions as electrons are confined in closer proximity to each other would become stronger than the attractive forces. The energy of the system would then rise Figure 8.2. (making the system destabilized), as shown at the far left of https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

Chapter 8 | Advanced Theories of Covalent Bonding 415 Figure 8.2 (a) The interaction of two hydrogen atoms changes as a function of distance. (b) The energy of the system changes as the atoms interact. The lowest (most stable) energy occurs at a distance of 74 pm, which is the bond length observed for the H2 molecule. The bond energy is the difference between the energy minimum (which occurs at the bond distance) and the energy of the two separated atoms. This is the quantity of energy released when the bond is formed. Conversely, the same Figure 8.2, amount of energy is required to break the bond. For the H2 molecule shown in at the bond distance of 74 10−19 × pm the system is 7.24 J lower in energy than the two separated hydrogen atoms. This may seem like a small number. However, we know from our earlier description of thermochemistry that bond energies are often discussed 10−19 105 × × on a per-mole basis. For example, it requires 7.24 J to break one H–H bond, but it takes 4.36 J to Table 8.1. break 1 mole of H–H bonds. A comparison of some bond lengths and energies is shown in We can find many of these bonds in a variety of molecules, and this table provides average values. For example, breaking the first C–H bond in CH4 requires 439.3 kJ/mol, while breaking the first C–H bond in H–CH2C6H5 (a common paint thinner) requires 375.5 kJ/mol.

Greater overlap is possible when orbitals are oriented such that they Figure 8.3 overlap on a direct line between the two nuclei. illustrates this for two p orbitals from different atoms; the overlap is greater when the orbitals overlap end to end rather than at an angle. Figure 8.3 (a) The overlap of two p orbitals is greatest when the orbitals are directed end to end. (b) Any other arrangement results in less overlap. The plus signs indicate the locations of the nuclei. The overlap of two s orbitals (as in H2), the overlap of an s orbital and a p orbital (as in HCl), and the end-to-end Figure 8.4. overlap of two p orbitals (as in Cl2) all produce sigma bonds (σ bonds), as illustrated in A σ bond is a covalent bond in which the electron density is concentrated in the region along the internuclear axis; that is, a line between the nuclei would pass through the center of the overlap region. Single bonds in Lewis structures are described as σ bonds in valence bond theory. Figure 8.4 Sigma (σ) bonds form from the overlap of the following: (a) two s orbitals, (b) an s orbital and a p orbital, and (c) two p orbitals. The plus signs indicate the locations of the nuclei. A pi bond (π bond) is a type of covalent bond that results from the side-by-side overlap of two p orbitals, as Figure 8.5. illustrated in In a π bond, the regions of orbital overlap lie on opposite sides of the internuclear axis.

Chapter 8 | Advanced Theories of Covalent Bonding 417 Figure 8.5 Pi (π) bonds form from the side-by-side overlap of two p orbitals. The plus signs indicate the location of the nuclei. While all single bonds are σ bonds, multiple bonds consist of both σ and π bonds. As the Lewis structures in suggest, O2 contains a double bond, and N2 contains a triple bond. The double bond consists of one σ bond and one π bond, and the triple bond consists of one σ bond and two π bonds. Between any two atoms, the first bond formed will always be a σ bond, but there can only be one σ bond in any one location. In any multiple bond, there will be one σ bond, and the remaining one or two bonds will be π bonds. These bonds are described in more detail later in this chapter. Table 8.1, As seen in an average carbon-carbon single bond is 347 kJ/mol, while in a carbon-carbon double bond, the π bond increases the bond strength by 267 kJ/mol. Adding an additional π bond causes a further increase of 225 kJ/mol. We can see a similar pattern when we compare other σ and π bonds. Thus, each individual π bond is generally weaker than a corresponding σ bond between the same two atoms. In a σ bond, there is a greater degree of orbital overlap than in a π bond. Example 8.1 Counting σ and π Bonds Butadiene, C6H6, is used to make synthetic rubber. Identify the number of σ and π bonds contained in this molecule. Solution There are six σ C–H bonds and one σ C–C bond, for a total of seven from the single bonds. There are two double bonds that each have a π bond in addition to the σ bond.

However, to understand how molecules with more than two atoms form stable bonds, we require a more detailed model. As an example, let us consider the water molecule, in which we have one oxygen atom bonding to 1s22s22p4, two hydrogen atoms. Oxygen has the electron configuration with two unpaired electrons (one in each of the two 2p orbitals). Valence bond theory would predict that the two O–H bonds form from the overlap of these two 2p orbitals with the 1s orbitals of the hydrogen atoms. If this were the case, the bond angle would be 90°, as shown Figure 8.6, in because p orbitals are perpendicular to each other. Experimental evidence shows that the bond angle is 104.5°, not 90°. The prediction of the valence bond theory model does not match the real-world observations of a water molecule; a different model is needed. Figure 8.6 The hypothetical overlap of two of the 2p orbitals on an oxygen atom (red) with the 1s orbitals of two evidence.[1] hydrogen atoms (blue) would produce a bond angle of 90°. This is not consistent with experimental Quantum-mechanical calculations suggest why the observed bond angles in H2O differ from those predicted by the overlap of the 1s orbital of the hydrogen atoms with the 2p orbitals of the oxygen atom. The mathematical expression known as the wave function, ψ, contains information about each orbital and the wavelike properties of electrons in an isolated atom. When atoms are bound together in a molecule, the wave functions combine to produce new mathematical descriptions that have different shapes. This process of combining the wave functions for atomic orbitals is called hybridization and is mathematically accomplished by the linear combination of atomic orbitals, LCAO, (a technique that we will encounter again later). The new orbitals that result are called hybrid orbitals. The valence orbitals in an isolated oxygen atom are a 2s orbital and three 2p orbitals. The valence orbitals in an oxygen atom in a water molecule differ; they consist of four equivalent hybrid orbitals that point approximately (Figure 8.7). toward the corners of a tetrahedron Consequently, the overlap of the O and H orbitals should result in a tetrahedral bond angle (109.5°). The observed angle of 104.5° is experimental evidence for which quantum- 1.

Chapter 8 | Advanced Theories of Covalent Bonding 419 mechanical calculations give a useful explanation: Valence bond theory must include a hybridization component to give accurate predictions. Figure 8.7 (a) A water molecule has four regions of electron density, so VSEPR theory predicts a tetrahedral arrangement of hybrid orbitals. (b) Two of the hybrid orbitals on oxygen contain lone pairs, and the other two overlap with the 1s orbitals of hydrogen atoms to form the O–H bonds in H2O. This description is more consistent with the experimental structure. The following ideas are important in understanding hybridization: Hybrid orbitals do not exist in isolated atoms. They are formed only in covalently bonded atoms. 1. Hybrid orbitals have shapes and orientations that are very different from those of the atomic orbitals in isolated 2. atoms. A set of hybrid orbitals is generated by combining atomic orbitals. The number of hybrid orbitals in a set is 3. equal to the number of atomic orbitals that were combined to produce the set. All orbitals in a set of hybrid orbitals are equivalent in shape and energy. 4. The type of hybrid orbitals formed in a bonded atom depends on its electron-pair geometry as predicted by the 5. VSEPR theory. Hybrid orbitals overlap to form σ bonds. Unhybridized orbitals overlap to form π bonds. 6. In the following sections, we shall discuss the common types of hybrid orbitals. sp Hybridization The beryllium atom in a gaseous BeCl2 molecule is an example of a central atom with no lone pairs of electrons in a linear arrangement of three atoms. There are two regions of valence electron density in the BeCl2 molecule that correspond to the two covalent Be–Cl bonds. To accommodate these two electron domains, two of the Be atom’s four valence orbitals will mix to yield two hybrid orbitals. This hybridization process involves mixing of the valence s orbital with one of the valence p orbitals to yield two equivalent sp hybrid orbitals that are oriented in a linear (Figure 8.8). geometry In this figure, the set of sp orbitals appears similar in shape to the original p orbital, but there is an important difference. The number of atomic orbitals combined always equals the number of hybrid orbitals formed. The p orbital is one orbital that can hold up to two electrons. The sp set is two equivalent orbitals that point 180° from each other. The two electrons that were originally in the s orbital are now distributed to the two sp orbitals, which are half filled. In gaseous BeCl2, these half-filled hybrid orbitals will overlap with orbitals from the chlorine atoms to form two identical σ bonds. 

--- Page 428 ---
420 Chapter 8 | Advanced Theories of Covalent Bonding Figure 8.8 Hybridization of an s orbital (blue) and a p orbital (red) of the same atom produces two sp hybrid orbitals (purple). Each hybrid orbital is oriented primarily in just one direction. Note that each sp orbital contains one lobe that is significantly larger than the other. The set of two sp orbitals are oriented at 180°, which is consistent with the geometry for two domains. We illustrate the electronic differences in an isolated Be atom and in the bonded Be atom in the orbital energy-level Figure 8.9. diagram in These diagrams represent each orbital by a horizontal line (indicating its energy) and each electron by an arrow. Energy increases toward the top of the diagram. We use one upward arrow to indicate one electron in an orbital and two arrows (up and down) to indicate two electrons of opposite spin. Figure 8.9 This orbital energy-level diagram shows the sp hybridized orbitals on Be in the linear BeCl2 molecule. Each of the two sp hybrid orbitals holds one electron and is thus half filled and available for bonding via overlap with a Cl 3p orbital. When atomic orbitals hybridize, the valence electrons occupy the newly created orbitals. The Be atom had two valence electrons, so each of the sp orbitals gets one of these electrons. Each of these electrons pairs up with the unpaired electron on a chlorine atom when a hybrid orbital and a chlorine orbital overlap during the formation of the Be–Cl bonds. https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

We will use these “thinner” representations whenever the true view is too crowded to easily visualize. sp2 Figure 8.11 This alternate way of drawing the trigonal planar hybrid orbitals is sometimes used in more crowded figures. sp2 The observed structure of the borane molecule, BH3, suggests hybridization for boron in this compound.

Chapter 8 | Advanced Theories of Covalent Bonding 423 sp2 Any central atom surrounded by three regions of electron density will exhibit hybridization. This includes (Figure 8.14), molecules with a lone pair on the central atom, such as ClNO or molecules with two single bonds and a double bond connected to the central atom, as in formaldehyde, CH2O, and ethene, H2CCH2. Figure 8.14 The central atom(s) in each of the structures shown contain three regions of electron density and are sp2 hybridized. As we know from the discussion of VSEPR theory, a region of electron density contains all of the electrons that point in one direction. A lone pair, an unpaired electron, a single bond, or a multiple bond would each count as one region of electron density. sp3 Hybridization The valence orbitals of an atom surrounded by a tetrahedral arrangement of bonding pairs and lone pairs consist of sp3 a set of four hybrid orbitals. The hybrids result from the mixing of one s orbital and all three p orbitals that sp3 (Figure 8.15). produces four identical hybrid orbitals Each of these hybrid orbitals points toward a different corner of a tetrahedron.

A molecule of methane, CH4, consists of a carbon atom surrounded by four hydrogen atoms at the corners of a sp3 tetrahedron. The carbon atom in methane exhibits hybridization.

Chapter 8 | Advanced Theories of Covalent Bonding 425 Figure 8.16 The four valence atomic orbitals from an isolated carbon atom all hybridize when the carbon bonds in a sp3 molecule like CH4 with four regions of electron density. This creates four equivalent hybridized orbitals. Overlap of each of the hybrid orbitals with a hydrogen orbital creates a C–H σ bond. sp3 In a methane molecule, the 1s orbital of each of the four hydrogen atoms overlaps with one of the four orbitals of the carbon atom to form a sigma (σ) bond. This results in the formation of four strong, equivalent covalent bonds between the carbon atom and each of the hydrogen atoms to produce the methane molecule, CH4. The structure of ethane, C2H6, is similar to that of methane in that each carbon in ethane has four neighboring atoms (Figure 8.17). arranged at the corners of a tetrahedron—three hydrogen atoms and one carbon atom However, in sp3 sp3 ethane an orbital of one carbon atom overlaps end to end with an orbital of a second carbon atom to form sp3 a σ bond between the two carbon atoms. Each of the remaining hybrid orbitals overlaps with an s orbital of a hydrogen atom to form carbon–hydrogen σ bonds. The structure and overall outline of the bonding orbitals of ethane Figure 8.17. are shown in The orientation of the two CH3 groups is not fixed relative to each other. Experimental evidence shows that rotation around σ bonds occurs easily. sp3 Figure 8.17 (a) In the ethane molecule, C2H6, each carbon has four orbitals. (b) These four orbitals overlap to form seven σ bonds. sp3 An hybrid orbital can also hold a lone pair of electrons. For example, the nitrogen atom in ammonia is surrounded by three bonding pairs and a lone pair of electrons directed to the four corners of a tetrahedron. The nitrogen atom is sp3 hybridized with one hybrid orbital occupied by the lone pair. The molecular structure of water is consistent with a tetrahedral arrangement of two lone pairs and two bonding pairs sp3 of electrons. Thus we say that the oxygen atom is hybridized, with two of the hybrid orbitals occupied by lone

426 Chapter 8 | Advanced Theories of Covalent Bonding pairs and two by bonding pairs. Since lone pairs occupy more space than bonding pairs, structures that contain lone pairs have bond angles slightly distorted from the ideal. Perfect tetrahedra have angles of 109.5°, but the observed sp3 angles in ammonia (107.3°) and water (104.5°) are slightly smaller. Other examples of hybridization include CCl4, PCl3, and NCl3. sp3d sp3d2 and Hybridization To describe the five bonding orbitals in a trigonal bipyramidal arrangement, we must use five of the valence shell sp3d atomic orbitals (the s orbital, the three p orbitals, and one of the d orbitals), which gives five hybrid orbitals. With an octahedral arrangement of six hybrid orbitals, we must use six valence shell atomic orbitals (the s orbital, sp3d2 the three p orbitals, and two of the d orbitals in its valence shell), which gives six hybrid orbitals. These hybridizations are only possible for atoms that have d orbitals in their valence subshells (that is, not those in the first or second period). In a molecule of phosphorus pentachloride, PCl5, there are five P–Cl bonds (thus five pairs of valence electrons around the phosphorus atom) directed toward the corners of a trigonal bipyramid. We use the 3s orbital, the three 3p sp3d (Figure 8.19) orbitals, and one of the 3d orbitals to form the set of five hybrid orbitals that are involved in the sp3d P–Cl bonds. Other atoms that exhibit hybridization include the sulfur atom in SF4 and the chlorine atoms in ClF3 +. ClF4 (The electrons on fluorine atoms are omitted for clarity.) and in sp3d Figure 8.18 The three compounds pictured exhibit hybridization in the central atom and a trigonal bipyramid + ClF4 form. SF4 and have one lone pair of electrons on the central atom, and ClF3 has two lone pairs giving it the T-shape shown. sp3d Figure 8.19 (a) The five regions of electron density around phosphorus in PCl5 require five hybrid orbitals. (b) These orbitals combine to form a trigonal bipyramidal structure with each large lobe of the hybrid orbital pointing at a vertex. As before, there are also small lobes pointing in the opposite direction for each orbital (not shown for clarity). sp3d2 The sulfur atom in sulfur hexafluoride, SF6, exhibits hybridization. A molecule of sulfur hexafluoride has six bonding pairs of electrons connecting six fluorine atoms to a single sulfur atom. There are no lone pairs of electrons on the central atom. To bond six fluorine atoms, the 3s orbital, the three 3p orbitals, and two of the 3d orbitals sp3d2 form six equivalent hybrid orbitals, each directed toward a different corner of an octahedron.

(b) The six sp3d2 orbitals form an octahedral structure around sulfur. Again, the minor lobe of each orbital is not shown for clarity. Assignment of Hybrid Orbitals to Central Atoms The hybridization of an atom is determined based on the number of regions of electron density that surround it. Figure 8.21. The geometrical arrangements characteristic of the various sets of hybrid orbitals are shown in These arrangements are identical to those of the electron-pair geometries predicted by VSEPR theory. VSEPR theory predicts the shapes of molecules, and hybrid orbital theory provides an explanation for how those shapes are formed. To find the hybridization of a central atom, we can use the following guidelines: Determine the Lewis structure of the molecule. 1. Determine the number of regions of electron density around an atom using VSEPR theory, in which single 2. bonds, multiple bonds, radicals, and lone pairs each count as one region. Figure 8.21 Assign the set of hybridized orbitals from that corresponds to this geometry. 3. 

--- Page 436 ---
428 Chapter 8 | Advanced Theories of Covalent Bonding Figure 8.21 The shapes of hybridized orbital sets are consistent with the electron-pair geometries. For example, an sp2 sp2 atom surrounded by three regions of electron density is hybridized, and the three orbitals are arranged in a trigonal planar fashion. It is important to remember that hybridization was devised to rationalize experimentally observed molecular geometries. The model works well for molecules containing small central atoms, in which the valence electron pairs are close together in space. However, for larger central atoms, the valence-shell electron pairs are farther from the nucleus, and there are fewer repulsions. Their compounds exhibit structures that are often not consistent with VSEPR theory, and hybridized orbitals are not necessary to explain the observed data. For example, we have discussed the sp3 H–O–H bond angle in H2O, 104.5°, which is more consistent with hybrid orbitals (109.5°) on the central atom than with 2p orbitals (90°). Sulfur is in the same group as oxygen, and H2S has a similar Lewis structure. However, it has a much smaller bond angle (92.1°), which indicates much less hybridization on sulfur than oxygen. Continuing down the group, tellurium is even larger than sulfur, and for H2Te, the observed bond angle (90°) is consistent with overlap of the 5p orbitals, without invoking hybridization. We invoke hybridization where it is necessary to explain the observed structures. https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

What is the hybridization of the two carbon atoms in acetic acid? sp3; sp2 Answer: H3C, C(O)OH, 8.3 Multiple Bonds By the end of this section, you will be able to: Describe multiple covalent bonding in terms of atomic orbital overlap • Relate the concept of resonance to π-bonding and electron delocalization • The hybrid orbital model appears to account well for the geometry of molecules involving single covalent bonds. Is it also capable of describing molecules containing double and triple bonds? We have already discussed that multiple bonds consist of σ and π bonds. Next we can consider how we visualize these components and how they relate to hybrid orbitals. The Lewis structure of ethene, C2H4, shows us that each carbon atom is surrounded by one other carbon atom and two hydrogen atoms. The three bonding regions form a trigonal planar electron-pair geometry. Thus we expect the σ bonds from each sp2 carbon atom are formed using a set of hybrid orbitals that result from hybridization of two of the 2p orbitals and C = C (Figure 8.22). the 2s orbital These orbitals form the C–H single bonds and the σ bond in the double bond C = C (Figure 8.23). double bond results from the overlap of the third (remaining) 2p orbital on The π bond in the Figure 8.23) each carbon atom that is not involved in hybridization. This unhybridized p orbital (shown in red in sp2 is perpendicular to the plane of the hybrid orbitals. Thus the unhybridized 2p orbitals overlap in a side-by-side (Figure 8.23) fashion, above and below the internuclear axis and form a π bond. https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at 

--- Page 439 ---
Chapter 8 | Advanced Theories of Covalent Bonding 431 sp2 sp2 Figure 8.22 In ethene, each carbon atom is hybridized, and the orbitals and the p orbital are singly occupied. The hybrid orbitals overlap to form σ bonds, while the p orbitals on each carbon atom overlap to form a π bond. Figure 8.23 In the ethene molecule, C2H4, there are (a) five σ bonds shown in purple. One C–C σ bond results from sp2 sp2 overlap of hybrid orbitals on the carbon atom with one hybrid orbital on the other carbon atom. Four C–H sp2 bonds result from the overlap between the orbitals with s orbitals on the hydrogen atoms. (b) The π bond is formed by the side-by-side overlap of the two unhybridized p orbitals in the two carbon atoms, which are shown in red. The two lobes of the π bond are above and below the plane of the σ system. In an ethene molecule, the four hydrogen atoms and the two carbon atoms are all in the same plane. If the two sp2 planes of hybrid orbitals tilted relative to each other, the p orbitals would not be oriented to overlap efficiently to create the π bond. The planar configuration for the ethene molecule occurs because it is the most stable bonding arrangement. This is a significant difference between σ and π bonds; rotation around single (σ) bonds occurs easily because the end-to-end orbital overlap does not depend on the relative orientation of the orbitals on each atom in the bond. In other words, rotation around the internuclear axis does not change the extent to which the σ bonding orbitals overlap because the bonding electron density is symmetric about the axis. Rotation about the internuclear axis is much more difficult for multiple bonds; however, this would drastically alter the off-axis overlap of the π bonding orbitals, essentially breaking the π bond. (Figure 8.24). In molecules with sp hybrid orbitals, two unhybridized p orbitals remain on the atom We find this H−C≡C−H, situation in acetylene, which is a linear molecule. The sp hybrid orbitals of the two carbon atoms (Figure 8.25). overlap end to end to form a σ bond between the carbon atoms The remaining sp orbitals form σ bonds with hydrogen atoms. The two unhybridized p orbitals per carbon are positioned such that they overlap side by side and, hence, form two π bonds. The two carbon atoms of acetylene are thus bound together by one σ bond and two π bonds, giving a triple bond.

C ≡C Figure 8.25 (a) In the acetylene molecule, C2H2, there are two C–H σ bonds and a triple bond involving one C–C σ bond and two C–C π bonds. The dashed lines, each connecting two lobes, indicate the side-by-side overlap of the four unhybridized p orbitals. (b) This shows the overall outline of the bonds in C2H2. The two lobes of each of the π bonds are positioned across from each other around the line of the C–C σ bond. Hybridization involves only σ bonds, lone pairs of electrons, and single unpaired electrons (radicals). Structures that account for these features describe the correct hybridization of the atoms. However, many structures also include resonance forms. Remember that resonance forms occur when various arrangements of π bonds are possible. Since the arrangement of π bonds involves only the unhybridized orbitals, resonance does not influence the assignment of hybridization. (Figure 8.26). For example, molecule benzene has two resonance forms We can use either of these forms to determine that each of the carbon atoms is bonded to three other atoms with no lone pairs, so the correct hybridization sp2. is The electrons in the unhybridized p orbitals form π bonds. Neither resonance structure completely describes the electrons in the π bonds. They are not located in one position or the other, but in reality are delocalized throughout the ring. Valence bond theory does not easily address delocalization. Bonding in molecules with resonance forms is better described by molecular orbital theory.

434 Chapter 8 | Advanced Theories of Covalent Bonding important molecules we know, the oxygen molecule O2, presents a problem with respect to its Lewis structure. We would write the following Lewis structure for O2: This electronic structure adheres to all the rules governing Lewis theory. There is an O=O double bond, and each oxygen atom has eight electrons around it. However, this picture is at odds with the magnetic behavior of oxygen. By itself, O2 is not magnetic, but it is attracted to magnetic fields. Thus, when we pour liquid oxygen past a strong Figure 8.1. magnet, it collects between the poles of the magnet and defies gravity, as in Such attraction to a magnetic field is called paramagnetism, and it arises in molecules that have unpaired electrons. And yet, the Lewis structure of O2 indicates that all electrons are paired. How do we account for this discrepancy? Magnetic susceptibility measures the force experienced by a substance in a magnetic field. When we compare the (Figure 8.27), weight of a sample to the weight measured in a magnetic field paramagnetic samples that are attracted to the magnet will appear heavier because of the force exerted by the magnetic field. We can calculate the number of unpaired electrons based on the increase in weight. Figure 8.27 A Gouy balance compares the mass of a sample in the presence of a magnetic field with the mass with the electromagnet turned off to determine the number of unpaired electrons in a sample. Experiments show that each O2 molecule has two unpaired electrons. The Lewis-structure model does not predict the presence of these two unpaired electrons. Unlike oxygen, the apparent weight of most molecules decreases slightly in the presence of an inhomogeneous magnetic field. Materials in which all of the electrons are paired are diamagnetic and weakly repel a magnetic field. Paramagnetic and diamagnetic materials do not act as permanent magnets. Only in the presence of an applied magnetic field do they demonstrate attraction or repulsion. https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

Chapter 8 | Advanced Theories of Covalent Bonding 435 Link to Learning Water, like most molecules, contains all paired electrons. Living things contain a large percentage of water, so they demonstrate diamagnetic behavior. If you place a frog near a sufficiently large magnet, it will levitate. You can see videos (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/16diamagnetic) of diamagnetic floating frogs, strawberries, and more. Molecular orbital theory (MO theory) provides an explanation of chemical bonding that accounts for the paramagnetism of the oxygen molecule. It also explains the bonding in a number of other molecules, such as violations of the octet rule and more molecules with more complicated bonding (beyond the scope of this text) that are difficult to describe with Lewis structures. Additionally, it provides a model for describing the energies of electrons in a molecule and the probable location of these electrons. Unlike valence bond theory, which uses hybrid orbitals that are assigned to one specific atom, MO theory uses the combination of atomic orbitals to yield molecular orbitals that are delocalized over the entire molecule rather than being localized on its constituent atoms. MO theory also helps us understand why some substances are electrical conductors, others are semiconductors, and still others are insulators. Table 8.2 summarizes the main points of the two complementary bonding theories. Both theories provide different, useful ways of describing molecular structure. Comparison of Bonding Theories Valence Bond Theory Molecular Orbital Theory considers bonds as localized between one pair of atoms considers electrons delocalized throughout the entire molecule creates bonds from overlap of atomic orbitals (s, p, d…) combines atomic orbitals to form molecular orbitals (σ, σ*, π, π*) sp2, sp3…) and hybrid orbitals (sp, forms σ or π bonds creates bonding and antibonding interactions based on which orbitals are filled predicts molecular shape based on the number of regions predicts the arrangement of electrons in molecules of electron density needs multiple structures to describe resonance Table 8.2 Molecular orbital theory describes the distribution of electrons in molecules in much the same way that the distribution of electrons in atoms is described using atomic orbitals. Using quantum mechanics, the behavior of an electron in a molecule is still described by a wave function, Ψ, analogous to the behavior in an atom. Just like electrons around isolated atoms, electrons around atoms in molecules are limited to discrete (quantized) energies. The region (Ψ2). of space in which a valence electron in a molecule is likely to be found is called a molecular orbital Like an atomic orbital, a molecular orbital is full when it contains two electrons with opposite spin. We will consider the molecular orbitals in molecules composed of two identical atoms (H2 or Cl2, for example). Such molecules are called homonuclear diatomic molecules. In these diatomic molecules, several types of molecular orbitals occur. The mathematical process of combining atomic orbitals to generate molecular orbitals is called the linear combination of atomic orbitals (LCAO). The wave function describes the wavelike properties of an electron.

436 Chapter 8 | Advanced Theories of Covalent Bonding Molecular orbitals are combinations of atomic orbital wave functions. Combining waves can lead to constructive interference, in which peaks line up with peaks, or destructive interference, in which peaks line up with troughs (Figure 8.28). In orbitals, the waves are three dimensional, and they combine with in-phase waves producing regions with a higher probability of electron density and out-of-phase waves producing nodes, or regions of no electron density. Figure 8.28 (a) When in-phase waves combine, constructive interference produces a wave with greater amplitude. (b) When out-of-phase waves combine, destructive interference produces a wave with less (or no) amplitude. There are two types of molecular orbitals that can form from the overlap of two atomic s orbitals on adjacent atoms. Figure 8.29. The two types are illustrated in The in-phase combination produces a lower energy σs molecular orbital (read as "sigma-s") in which most of the electron density is directly between the nuclei. The out-of-phase addition (which can also be thought of as subtracting the wave functions) produces a higher energy molecular orbital (read as "sigma-s-star") molecular orbital in which there is a node between the nuclei. The asterisk signifies that the orbital is an antibonding orbital. Electrons in a σs orbital are attracted by both nuclei at the same time and are more stable (of lower energy) than they would be in the isolated atoms. Adding electrons to these orbitals creates a force σs* orbitals are located that holds the two nuclei together, so we call these orbitals bonding orbitals. Electrons in the well away from the region between the two nuclei. The attractive force between the nuclei and these electrons pulls the two nuclei apart. Hence, these orbitals are called antibonding orbitals. Electrons fill the lower-energy bonding orbital before the higher-energy antibonding orbital, just as they fill lower-energy atomic orbitals before they fill higher-energy atomic orbitals.

In p orbitals, the wave function gives rise to two lobes with opposite phases, analogous to how a two-dimensional wave has both parts above and below the average. We indicate the phases by shading the orbital lobes different colors. When orbital lobes of the same phase overlap, constructive wave interference increases the electron density. When regions of opposite phase overlap, the destructive wave interference decreases electron density and creates nodes. (Figure 8.30). When p orbitals overlap end to end, they create σ and σ* orbitals If two atoms are located along σ * the x-axis in a Cartesian coordinate system, the two px orbitals overlap end to end and form σpx (bonding) and px (antibonding) (read as "sigma-p-x" and "sigma-p-x star," respectively). Just as with s-orbital overlap, the asterisk indicates the orbital with a node between the nuclei, which is a higher-energy, antibonding orbital. Figure 8.30 Combining wave functions of two p atomic orbitals along the internuclear axis creates two molecular σ p* . orbitals, σp and The side-by-side overlap of two p orbitals gives rise to a pi (π) bonding molecular orbital and a π* antibonding Figure 8.31. molecular orbital, as shown in In valence bond theory, we describe π bonds as containing a nodal plane containing the internuclear axis and perpendicular to the lobes of the p orbitals, with electron density on either side of the node. In molecular orbital theory, we describe the π orbital by this same shape, and a π bond exists when this orbital contains electrons. Electrons in this orbital interact with both nuclei and help hold the two atoms together, making it a bonding orbital. For the out-of-phase combination, there are two nodal planes created, one along the internuclear axis and a perpendicular one between the nuclei.

Combining the out-of-phase orbitals results in an antibonding molecular orbital with two nodes. One contains the axis, and one contains the perpendicular. Combining the in-phase orbitals results in a bonding orbital. There is a node (blue line) directly along the internuclear axis, but the orbital is located between the nuclei (red dots) above and below this node. In the molecular orbitals of diatomic molecules, each atom also has two sets of p orbitals oriented side by side (py π * and pz), so these four atomic orbitals combine pairwise to create two π orbitals and two π* orbitals. The πpy and py π * orbitals are oriented at right angles to the πpz and orbitals. Except for their orientation, the πpy and πpz orbitals pz π * π * are identical and have the same energy; they are degenerate orbitals.

(credit: image courtesy of Walter Kohn) Kohn’s biography has been remarkable outside the realm of physical chemistry as well. He was born in Austria, and during World War II he was part of the Kindertransport program that rescued 10,000 children from the Nazi regime. His summer jobs included discovering gold deposits in Canada and helping Polaroid explain how its instant film worked. Although he is now an emeritus professor, he is still actively working on projects involving global warming and renewable energy. How Sciences Interconnect Computational Chemistry in Drug Design While the descriptions of bonding described in this chapter involve many theoretical concepts, they also have many practical, real-world applications. For example, drug design is an important field that uses our understanding of chemical bonding to develop pharmaceuticals. This interdisciplinary area of study uses biology (understanding diseases and how they operate) to identify specific targets, such as a binding site that is involved in a disease pathway. By modeling the structures of the binding site and potential drugs, computational chemists can predict which structures can fit together and how effectively they will bind (see Figure 8.33). Thousands of potential candidates can be narrowed down to a few of the most promising candidates. These candidate molecules are then carefully tested to determine side effects, how effectively they can be transported through the body, and other factors. Dozens of important new pharmaceuticals have been discovered with the aid of computational chemistry, and new research projects are underway. https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

By designing molecules that bind to this protein, scientists are able to drastically inhibit the progress of the disease. Molecular Orbital Energy Diagrams The relative energy levels of atomic and molecular orbitals are typically shown in a molecular orbital diagram (Figure 8.34). For a diatomic molecule, the atomic orbitals of one atom are shown on the left, and those of the other atom are shown on the right. Each horizontal line represents one orbital that can hold two electrons. The molecular orbitals formed by the combination of the atomic orbitals are shown in the center. Dashed lines show which of the atomic orbitals combine to form the molecular orbitals. For each pair of atomic orbitals that combine, one lower-energy (bonding) molecular orbital and one higher-energy (antibonding) orbital result. Thus we can see that combining the six 2p atomic orbitals results in three bonding orbitals (one σ and two π) and three antibonding orbitals (one σ* and two π*). We predict the distribution of electrons in these molecular orbitals by filling the orbitals in the same way that we fill atomic orbitals, by the Aufbau principle. Lower-energy orbitals fill first, electrons spread out among degenerate (Figure 8.34). orbitals before pairing, and each orbital can hold a maximum of two electrons with opposite spins Just as we write electron configurations for atoms, we can write the molecular electronic configuration by listing the orbitals with superscripts indicating the number of electrons present. For clarity, we place parentheses around molecular orbitals with the same energy. In this case, each orbital is at a different energy, so parentheses separate each +) Be2 would have the orbital. Thus we would expect a diatomic molecule or ion containing seven electrons (such as (σ1s)2 )2 (σ2s)2 )1.

The molecular orbitals are filled in the same manner as atomic orbitals, using the Aufbau principle and Hund’s rule. Bond Order The filled molecular orbital diagram shows the number of electrons in both bonding and antibonding molecular orbitals. The net contribution of the electrons to the bond strength of a molecule is identified by determining the bond order that results from the filling of the molecular orbitals by electrons. When using Lewis structures to describe the distribution of electrons in molecules, we define bond order as the number of bonding pairs of electrons between two atoms. Thus a single bond has a bond order of 1, a double bond has a bond order of 2, and a triple bond has a bond order of 3. We define bond order differently when we use the molecular orbital description of the distribution of electrons, but the resulting bond order is usually the same. The MO technique is more accurate and can handle cases when the Lewis structure method fails, but both methods describe the same phenomenon. In the molecular orbital model, an electron contributes to a bonding interaction if it occupies a bonding orbital and it contributes to an antibonding interaction if it occupies an antibonding orbital. The bond order is calculated by subtracting the destabilizing (antibonding) electrons from the stabilizing (bonding) electrons. Since a bond consists of two electrons, we divide by two to get the bond order. We can determine bond order with the following equation: ⎛ ⎞ ⎛ ⎞ ⎝number of bonding electrons ⎠− ⎝number of antibonding electrons ⎠ bond order = 2 The order of a covalent bond is a guide to its strength; a bond between two given atoms becomes stronger as the (Table 8.1). bond order increases If the distribution of electrons in the molecular orbitals between two atoms is such https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

Chapter 8 | Advanced Theories of Covalent Bonding 443 that the resulting bond would have a bond order of zero, a stable bond does not form. We next look at some specific examples of MO diagrams and bond orders. Bonding in Diatomic Molecules A dihydrogen molecule (H2) forms from two hydrogen atoms. When the atomic orbitals of the two atoms combine, the electrons occupy the molecular orbital of lowest energy, the σ1s bonding orbital. A dihydrogen molecule, H2, readily forms because the energy of a H2 molecule is lower than that of two H atoms. The σ1s orbital that contains both electrons is lower in energy than either of the two 1s atomic orbitals. A molecular orbital can hold two electrons, so both electrons in the H2 molecule are in the σ1s bonding orbital; the (σ1s)2. (Figure electron configuration is We represent this configuration by a molecular orbital energy diagram 8.35) in which a single upward arrow indicates one electron in an orbital, and two (upward and downward) arrows indicate two electrons of opposite spin. Figure 8.35 The molecular orbital energy diagram predicts that H2 will be a stable molecule with lower energy than the separated atoms. A dihydrogen molecule contains two bonding electrons and no antibonding electrons so we have (2 −0) bond order in H2 = = 1 2 Because the bond order for the H–H bond is equal to 1, the bond is a single bond. A helium atom has two electrons, both of which are in its 1s orbital. Two helium atoms do not combine to form a dihelium molecule, He2, with four electrons, because the stabilizing effect of the two electrons in the lower-energy bonding orbital would be offset by the destabilizing effect of the two electrons in the higher-energy antibonding (σ1s)2 )2 (σ1s* Figure 8.36. molecular orbital. We would write the hypothetical electron configuration of He2 as as in The net energy change would be zero, so there is no driving force for helium atoms to form the diatomic molecule. In fact, helium exists as discrete atoms rather than as diatomic molecules. The bond order in a hypothetical dihelium molecule would be zero. (2 −2) bond order in He2 = = 0 2 A bond order of zero indicates that no bond is formed between two atoms. 

--- Page 452 ---
444 Chapter 8 | Advanced Theories of Covalent Bonding Figure 8.36 The molecular orbital energy diagram predicts that He2 will not be a stable molecule, since it has equal numbers of bonding and antibonding electrons. The Diatomic Molecules of the Second Period Eight possible homonuclear diatomic molecules might be formed by the atoms of the second period of the periodic table: Li2, Be2, B2, C2, N2, O2, F2, and Ne2. However, we can predict that the Be2 molecule and the Ne2 molecule (Table 8.3). would not be stable. We can see this by a consideration of the molecular electron configurations We predict valence molecular orbital electron configurations just as we predict electron configurations of atoms. Valence electrons are assigned to valence molecular orbitals with the lowest possible energies. Consistent with Hund’s rule, whenever there are two or more degenerate molecular orbitals, electrons fill each orbital of that type singly before any pairing of electrons takes place. As we saw in valence bond theory, σ bonds are generally more stable than π bonds formed from degenerate atomic orbitals. Similarly, in molecular orbital theory, σ orbitals are usually more stable than π orbitals. However, this is Figure 8.37. not always the case. The MOs for the valence orbitals of the second period are shown in Looking at Ne2 molecular orbitals, we see that the order is consistent with the generic diagram shown in the previous section. However, for atoms with three or fewer electrons in the p orbitals (Li through N) we observe a different pattern, in which the σp orbital is higher in energy than the πp set. Obtain the molecular orbital diagram for a homonuclear diatomic ion by adding or subtracting electrons from the diagram for the neutral molecule. https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

Chapter 8 | Advanced Theories of Covalent Bonding 445 Figure 8.37 This shows the MO diagrams for each homonuclear diatomic molecule in the second period. The orbital energies decrease across the period as the effective nuclear charge increases and atomic radius decreases. Between N2 and O2, the order of the orbitals changes. Link to Learning You can practice labeling and filling molecular orbitals with this interactive tutorial (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/16labelorbital) from the University of Sydney. This switch in orbital ordering occurs because of a phenomenon called s-p mixing. s-p mixing does not create new orbitals; it merely influences the energies of the existing molecular orbitals. The σs wavefunction mathematically combines with the σp wavefunction, with the result that the σs orbital becomes more stable, and the σp orbital becomes (Figure 8.38). less stable Similarly, the antibonding orbitals also undergo s-p mixing, with the σs* becoming more stable and the σp* becoming less stable. 

--- Page 454 ---
446 Chapter 8 | Advanced Theories of Covalent Bonding Figure 8.38 Without mixing, the MO pattern occurs as expected, with the σp orbital lower in energy than the σp orbitals. When s-p mixing occurs, the orbitals shift as shown, with the σp orbital higher in energy than the πp orbitals. s-p mixing occurs when the s and p orbitals have similar energies. When a single p orbital contains a pair of electrons, the act of pairing the electrons raises the energy of the orbital. Thus the 2p orbitals for O, F, and Ne are higher in energy than the 2p orbitals for Li, Be, B, C, and N. Because of this, O2, F2, and N2 only have negligible s-p mixing Figure (not sufficient to change the energy ordering), and their MO diagrams follow the normal pattern, as shown in 8.37. All of the other period 2 diatomic molecules do have s-p mixing, which leads to the pattern where the σp orbital is raised above the πp set. Figure 8.37, Using the MO diagrams shown in we can add in the electrons and determine the molecular electron Table 8.3, configuration and bond order for each of the diatomic molecules. As shown in Be2 and Ne2 molecules would have a bond order of 0, and these molecules do not exist.

Each of the two lithium atoms has one valence electron. Hence, we have two valence electrons available for the σ2s bonding molecular orbital. Because both valence electrons would be in a bonding orbital, we would predict the Li2 molecule to be stable. The molecule is, in fact, present in appreciable concentration in lithium vapor at temperatures near the boiling point of the element. All of the other molecules in Table 8.3 with a bond order greater than zero are also known. ⎛ ⎞ ⎝π2py ⎠level. * , π2pz * We expect the two electrons that occupy The O2 molecule has enough electrons to half fill the these two degenerate orbitals to be unpaired, and this molecular electronic configuration for O2 is in accord with the (Figure 8.40). fact that the oxygen molecule has two unpaired electrons The presence of two unpaired electrons has proved to be difficult to explain using Lewis structures, but the molecular orbital theory explains it quite well. In fact, the unpaired electrons of the oxygen molecule provide a strong piece of support for the molecular orbital theory. How Sciences Interconnect Band Theory When two identical atomic orbitals on different atoms combine, two molecular orbitals result (see Figure 8.29). The bonding orbital is lower in energy than the original atomic orbitals because the atomic orbitals are in-phase in the molecular orbital. The antibonding orbital is higher in energy than the original atomic orbitals because the atomic orbitals are out-of-phase. In a solid, similar things happen, but on a much larger scale. Remember that even in a small sample there 1023 are a huge number of atoms (typically > atoms), and therefore a huge number of atomic orbitals that may be combined into molecular orbitals. When N valence atomic orbitals, all of the same energy and each containing one (1) electron, are combined, N/2 (filled) bonding orbitals and N/2 (empty) antibonding orbitals will result. Each bonding orbital will show an energy lowering as the atomic orbitals are mostly in-phase, but each of the bonding orbitals will be a little different and have slightly different energies. The antibonding orbitals will 

--- Page 456 ---
448 Chapter 8 | Advanced Theories of Covalent Bonding show an increase in energy as the atomic orbitals are mostly out-of-phase, but each of the antibonding orbitals will also be a little different and have slightly different energies. The allowed energy levels for all the bonding orbitals are so close together that they form a band, called the valence band. Likewise, all the antibonding orbitals are very close together and form a band, called the conduction band. Figure 8.39 shows the bands for three important classes of materials: insulators, semiconductors, and conductors. Figure 8.39 Molecular orbitals in solids are so closely spaced that they are described as bands. The valence band is lower in energy and the conduction band is higher in energy. The type of solid is determined by the size of the “band gap” between the valence and conduction bands. Only a very small amount of energy is required to move electrons from the valance band to the conduction band in a conductor, and so they conduct electricity well. In an insulator, the band gap is large, so that very few electrons move, and they are poor conductors of electricity. Semiconductors are in between: they conduct electricity better than insulators, but not as well as conductors. In order to conduct electricity, electrons must move from the filled valence band to the empty conduction band where they can move throughout the solid. The size of the band gap, or the energy difference between the top of the valence band and the bottom of the conduction band, determines how easy it is to move electrons between the bands. Only a small amount of energy is required in a conductor because the band gap is very small. This small energy difference is “easy” to overcome, so they are good conductors of electricity. In an insulator, the band gap is so “large” that very few electrons move into the conduction band; as a result, insulators are poor conductors of electricity. Semiconductors conduct electricity when “moderate” amounts of energy are provided to move electrons out of the valence band and into the conduction band. Semiconductors, such as silicon, are found in many electronics. Semiconductors are used in devices such as computers, smartphones, and solar cells. Solar cells produce electricity when light provides the energy to move electrons out of the valence band. The electricity that is generated may then be used to power a light or tool, or it can be stored for later use by charging a battery. As of December 2014, up to 46% of the energy in sunlight could be converted into electricity using solar cells.

When the orbitals overlap along an axis containing the nuclei, they form a σ bond. When they overlap in a fashion that creates a node along this axis, they form a π bond. 8.2 Hybrid Atomic Orbitals We can use hybrid orbitals, which are mathematical combinations of some or all of the valence atomic orbitals, to describe the electron density around covalently bonded atoms. These hybrid orbitals either form sigma (σ) bonds directed toward other atoms of the molecule or contain lone pairs of electrons. We can determine the type of hybridization around a central atom from the geometry of the regions of electron density about it. Two such regions sp2 sp3 sp3d sp3d2 imply sp hybridization; three, hybridization; four, hybridization; five, hybridization; and six, hybridization. Pi (π) bonds are formed from unhybridized atomic orbitals (p or d orbitals). 8.3 Multiple Bonds Multiple bonds consist of a σ bond located along the axis between two atoms and one or two π bonds. The σ bonds are usually formed by the overlap of hybridized atomic orbitals, while the π bonds are formed by the side-by-side overlap of unhybridized orbitals. Resonance occurs when there are multiple unhybridized orbitals with the appropriate alignment to overlap, so the placement of π bonds can vary. 8.4 Molecular Orbital Theory Molecular orbital (MO) theory describes the behavior of electrons in a molecule in terms of combinations of the atomic wave functions. The resulting molecular orbitals may extend over all the atoms in the molecule. Bonding molecular orbitals are formed by in-phase combinations of atomic wave functions, and electrons in these orbitals stabilize a molecule. Antibonding molecular orbitals result from out-of-phase combinations of atomic wave functions and electrons in these orbitals make a molecule less stable. Molecular orbitals located along an internuclear axis are https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

Chapter 8 | Advanced Theories of Covalent Bonding 453 called σ MOs. They can be formed from s orbitals or from p orbitals oriented in an end-to-end fashion. Molecular orbitals formed from p orbitals oriented in a side-by-side fashion have electron density on opposite sides of the internuclear axis and are called π orbitals. We can describe the electronic structure of diatomic molecules by applying molecular orbital theory to the valence electrons of the atoms. Electrons fill molecular orbitals following the same rules that apply to filling atomic orbitals; Hund’s rule and the Aufbau principle tell us that lower-energy orbitals will fill first, electrons will spread out before they pair up, and each orbital can hold a maximum of two electrons with opposite spins. Materials with unpaired electrons are paramagnetic and attracted to a magnetic field, while those with all-paired electrons are diamagnetic and repelled by a magnetic field. Correctly predicting the magnetic properties of molecules is in advantage of molecular orbital theory over Lewis structures and valence bond theory. Exercises 8.1 Valence Bond Theory 1.

Heated gases expand, which can make a hot air balloon rise or cause a blowout in a bicycle tire left in the sun on a hot day. Gases have played an important part in the development of chemistry. In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, many scientists investigated gas behavior, providing the first mathematical descriptions of the behavior of matter. In this chapter, we will examine the relationships between gas temperature, pressure, amount, and volume. We will study a simple theoretical model and use it to analyze the experimental behavior of gases. The results of these analyses will show us the limitations of the theory and how to improve on it.

460 Chapter 9 | Gases 9.1 Gas Pressure By the end of this section, you will be able to: Define the property of pressure • Define and convert among the units of pressure measurements • Describe the operation of common tools for measuring gas pressure • Calculate pressure from manometer data • The earth’s atmosphere exerts a pressure, as does any other gas. Although we do not normally notice atmospheric pressure, we are sensitive to pressure changes—for example, when your ears “pop” during take-off and landing while flying, or when you dive underwater. Gas pressure is caused by the force exerted by gas molecules colliding with (Figure 9.2). the surfaces of objects Although the force of each collision is very small, any surface of appreciable area experiences a large number of collisions in a short time, which can result in a high pressure. In fact, normal air pressure is strong enough to crush a metal container when not balanced by equal pressure from inside the container. Figure 9.2 The atmosphere above us exerts a large pressure on objects at the surface of the earth, roughly equal to the weight of a bowling ball pressing on an area the size of a human thumbnail. Link to Learning A dramatic illustration (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/16atmospressur1) of atmospheric pressure is provided in this brief video, which shows a railway tanker car imploding when its internal pressure is decreased. A smaller scale demonstration (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/16atmospressur2) of this phenomenon is briefly explained. Atmospheric pressure is caused by the weight of the column of air molecules in the atmosphere above an object, such as the tanker car. At sea level, this pressure is roughly the same as that exerted by a full-grown African elephant standing on a doormat, or a typical bowling ball resting on your thumbnail. These may seem like huge amounts, and they are, but life on earth has evolved under such atmospheric pressure. If you actually perch a bowling ball on your thumbnail, the pressure experienced is twice the usual pressure, and the sensation is unpleasant. https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

Chapter 9 | Gases 461 F P = A. In general, pressure is defined as the force exerted on a given area: Note that pressure is directly proportional to force and inversely proportional to area. Thus, pressure can be increased either by increasing the amount of force or by decreasing the area over which it is applied; pressure can be decreased by decreasing the force or increasing the area. Figure 9.3—the Let’s apply this concept to determine which would be more likely to fall through thin ice in elephant or the figure skater? A large African elephant can weigh 7 tons, supported on four feet, each with a diameter of about in2), lb/in2: 1.5 ft (footprint area of 250 so the pressure exerted by each foot is about 14 1 elephant lb 1 foot lb/in2 pressure per elephant foot = 14,000 × × = 14 elephant 4 feet in2 250 in2, The figure skater weighs about 120 lbs, supported on two skate blades, each with an area of about 2 so the lb/in2: pressure exerted by each blade is about 30 lb 1 skater 1 blade lb/in2 pressure per skate blade = 120 × × = 30 skater 2 blades in2 2 Even though the elephant is more than one hundred-times heavier than the skater, it exerts less than one-half of the pressure and would therefore be less likely to fall though thin ice. On the other hand, if the skater removes her skates and stands with bare feet (or regular footwear) on the ice, the larger area over which her weight is applied greatly reduces the pressure exerted: lb 1 skater 1 foot lb/in2 pressure per human foot = 120 × × = 2 skater 2 feet in2 30 Figure 9.3 Although (a) an elephant’s weight is large, creating a very large force on the ground, (b) the figure skater exerts a much higher pressure on the ice due to the small surface area of her skates.

In the United States, pressure is often measured in pounds of force on an area of one square inch—pounds per square inch (psi)—for example, in car tires. Pressure can also be measured using the unit atmosphere (atm), which originally represented the average sea level air pressure at the approximate latitude of Table 9.1 Paris (45°). provides some information on these and a few other common units for pressure measurements

What is this pressure in atmospheres, in millimeters of mercury, in kilopascals, and in bar? Answer: 0.974 atm; 740 mm Hg; 98.7 kPa; 0.987 bar We can measure atmospheric pressure, the force exerted by the atmosphere on the earth’s surface, with a barometer (Figure 9.4). A barometer is a glass tube that is closed at one end, filled with a nonvolatile liquid such as mercury, and then inverted and immersed in a container of that liquid. The atmosphere exerts pressure on the liquid outside the tube, the column of liquid exerts pressure inside the tube, and the pressure at the liquid surface is the same inside and outside the tube. The height of the liquid in the tube is therefore proportional to the pressure exerted by the atmosphere. Figure 9.4 In a barometer, the height, h, of the column of liquid is used as a measurement of the air pressure. Using very dense liquid mercury (left) permits the construction of reasonably sized barometers, whereas using water (right) would require a barometer more than 30 feet tall. If the liquid is water, normal atmospheric pressure will support a column of water over 10 meters high, which is rather inconvenient for making (and reading) a barometer. Because mercury (Hg) is about 13.6-times denser than water, a 1 mercury barometer only needs to be as tall as a water barometer—a more suitable size. Standard atmospheric 13.6 pressure of 1 atm at sea level (101,325 Pa) corresponds to a column of mercury that is about 760 mm (29.92 in.) high. The torr was originally intended to be a unit equal to one millimeter of mercury, but it no longer corresponds exactly. The pressure exerted by a fluid due to gravity is known as hydrostatic pressure, p: p = hρg where h is the height of the fluid, ρ is the density of the fluid, and g is acceleration due to gravity.

The hydrostatic pressure is given by p = hρg, with h = 760 mm, ρ = 13.6 and g = 9.81 Plugging these values into the equation and doing the necessary unit conversions will give us the value we seek.

The g/cm3. density of water at this temperature is 1.0 Answer: 10.3 m A manometer is a device similar to a barometer that can be used to measure the pressure of a gas trapped in a container. A closed-end manometer is a U-shaped tube with one closed arm, one arm that connects to the gas to be measured, and a nonvolatile liquid (usually mercury) in between. As with a barometer, the distance between the liquid levels in the two arms of the tube (h in the diagram) is proportional to the pressure of the gas in the container. (Figure 9.5) An open-end manometer is the same as a closed-end manometer, but one of its arms is open to the atmosphere. In this case, the distance between the liquid levels corresponds to the difference in pressure between the gas in the container and the atmosphere. Figure 9.5 A manometer can be used to measure the pressure of a gas. The (difference in) height between the liquid levels (h) is a measure of the pressure. Mercury is usually used because of its large density. https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

It consists of an inflatable cuff to restrict blood flow, a manometer to measure the pressure, and a method of determining when blood flow begins and when it becomes impeded (Figure 9.6). Since its invention in 1881, it has been an essential medical device. There are many types of sphygmomanometers: manual ones that require a stethoscope and are used by medical professionals; mercury ones, used when the most accuracy is required; less accurate mechanical ones; and digital ones that can be used with little training but that have limitations. When using a sphygmomanometer, the cuff is placed around the upper arm and inflated until blood flow is completely blocked, then slowly released. As the heart beats, blood forced through the arteries causes a rise in pressure. This rise in pressure at which blood flow begins is the systolic pressure—the peak pressure in the cardiac cycle. When the cuff’s pressure equals the arterial systolic pressure, blood flows past the cuff, creating audible sounds that can be heard using a stethoscope. This is followed by a decrease in pressure as the heart’s ventricles prepare for another beat. As cuff pressure continues to decrease, eventually sound is no longer heard; this is the diastolic pressure—the lowest pressure (resting phase) in the cardiac cycle. Blood pressure units from a sphygmomanometer are in terms of millimeters of mercury (mm Hg). Figure 9.6 (a) A medical technician prepares to measure a patient’s blood pressure with a sphygmomanometer. (b) A typical sphygmomanometer uses a valved rubber bulb to inflate the cuff and a diaphragm gauge to measure pressure. (credit a: modification of work by Master Sgt. Jeffrey Allen)

468 Chapter 9 | Gases How Sciences Interconnect Meteorology, Climatology, and Atmospheric Science Throughout the ages, people have observed clouds, winds, and precipitation, trying to discern patterns and make predictions: when it is best to plant and harvest; whether it is safe to set out on a sea voyage; and much more. We now face complex weather and atmosphere-related challenges that will have a major impact on our civilization and the ecosystem. Several different scientific disciplines use chemical principles to help us better understand weather, the atmosphere, and climate. These are meteorology, climatology, and atmospheric science. Meteorology is the study of the atmosphere, atmospheric phenomena, and atmospheric effects on earth’s weather. Meteorologists seek to understand and predict the weather in the short term, which can save lives and benefit the economy. Weather forecasts (Figure 9.7) are the result of thousands of measurements of air pressure, temperature, and the like, which are compiled, modeled, and analyzed in weather centers worldwide. Figure 9.7 Meteorologists use weather maps to describe and predict weather. Regions of high (H) and low (L) pressure have large effects on weather conditions. The gray lines represent locations of constant pressure known as isobars. (credit: modification of work by National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) In terms of weather, low-pressure systems occur when the earth’s surface atmospheric pressure is lower than the surrounding environment: Moist air rises and condenses, producing clouds. Movement of moisture and air within various weather fronts instigates most weather events. The atmosphere is the gaseous layer that surrounds a planet. Earth’s atmosphere, which is roughly 100–125 km thick, consists of roughly 78.1% nitrogen and 21.0% oxygen, and can be subdivided further into the regions shown in Figure 9.8: the exosphere (furthest from earth, > 700 km above sea level), the thermosphere (80–700 km), the mesosphere (50–80 km), the stratosphere (second lowest level of our atmosphere, 12–50 km above sea level), and the troposphere (up to 12 km above sea level, roughly 80% of the earth’s atmosphere by mass and the layer where most weather events originate). As you go higher in the troposphere, air density and temperature both decrease. https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at 

--- Page 477 ---
Chapter 9 | Gases 469 Figure 9.8 Earth’s atmosphere has five layers: the troposphere, the stratosphere, the mesosphere, the thermosphere, and the exosphere. Climatology is the study of the climate, averaged weather conditions over long time periods, using atmospheric data. However, climatologists study patterns and effects that occur over decades, centuries, and millennia, rather than shorter time frames of hours, days, and weeks like meteorologists. Atmospheric science is an even broader field, combining meteorology, climatology, and other scientific disciplines that study the atmosphere. 9.2 Relating Pressure, Volume, Amount, and Temperature: The Ideal Gas Law By the end of this section, you will be able to: Identify the mathematical relationships between the various properties of gases • Use the ideal gas law, and related gas laws, to compute the values of various gas properties under • specified conditions During the seventeenth and especially eighteenth centuries, driven both by a desire to understand nature and a quest (Figure 9.9), to make balloons in which they could fly a number of scientists established the relationships between the macroscopic physical properties of gases, that is, pressure, volume, temperature, and amount of gas. Although their measurements were not precise by today’s standards, they were able to determine the mathematical relationships between pairs of these variables (e.g., pressure and temperature, pressure and volume) that hold for an ideal gas—a hypothetical construct that real gases approximate under certain conditions. Eventually, these individual laws were combined into a single equation—the ideal gas law—that relates gas quantities for gases and is quite accurate for low pressures and moderate temperatures. We will consider the key developments in individual relationships (for pedagogical reasons not quite in historical order), then put them together in the ideal gas law.

When the hydrogen-filled balloon depicted in (a) landed, the frightened villagers of Gonesse reportedly destroyed it with pitchforks and knives. The launch of the latter was reportedly viewed by 400,000 people in Paris. Pressure and Temperature: Amontons’s Law Imagine filling a rigid container attached to a pressure gauge with gas and then sealing the container so that no gas may escape. If the container is cooled, the gas inside likewise gets colder and its pressure is observed to decrease. Since the container is rigid and tightly sealed, both the volume and number of moles of gas remain constant. If we (Figure 9.10) heat the sphere, the gas inside gets hotter and the pressure increases. Figure 9.10 The effect of temperature on gas pressure: When the hot plate is off, the pressure of the gas in the sphere is relatively low. As the gas is heated, the pressure of the gas in the sphere increases. This relationship between temperature and pressure is observed for any sample of gas confined to a constant volume. Figure An example of experimental pressure-temperature data is shown for a sample of air under these conditions in 9.11. We find that temperature and pressure are linearly related, and if the temperature is on the kelvin scale, then P and T are directly proportional (again, when volume and moles of gas are held constant); if the temperature on the kelvin scale increases by a certain factor, the gas pressure increases by the same factor. https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

Chapter 9 | Gases 471 Figure 9.11 For a constant volume and amount of air, the pressure and temperature are directly proportional, provided the temperature is in kelvin. (Measurements cannot be made at lower temperatures because of the condensation of the gas.) When this line is extrapolated to lower pressures, it reaches a pressure of 0 at –273 °C, which is 0 on the kelvin scale and the lowest possible temperature, called absolute zero. Guillaume Amontons was the first to empirically establish the relationship between the pressure and the temperature of a gas (~1700), and Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac determined the relationship more precisely (~1800). Because of this, the P-T relationship for gases is known as either Amontons’s law or Gay-Lussac’s law. Under either name, it states that the pressure of a given amount of gas is directly proportional to its temperature on the kelvin scale when the volume is held constant. Mathematically, this can be written: P ∝T or P = constant × T or P = k × T ∝means where “is proportional to,” and k is a proportionality constant that depends on the identity, amount, and volume of the gas. P P = k For a confined, constant volume of gas, the ratio is therefore constant (i.e., ). If the gas is initially in T T “Condition 1” (with P = P1 and T = T1), and then changes to “Condition 2” (with P = P2 and T = T2), we have that P1 P2 P1 P2 = k = k, = . and which reduces to This equation is useful for pressure-temperature calculations T1 T2 T1 T2 for a confined gas at constant volume. Note that temperatures must be on the kelvin scale for any gas law calculations (0 on the kelvin scale and the lowest possible temperature is called absolute zero). (Also note that there are at least three ways we can describe how the pressure of a gas changes as its temperature changes: We can use a table of values, a graph, or a mathematical equation.) Example 9.5 Predicting Change in Pressure with Temperature A can of hair spray is used until it is empty except for the propellant, isobutane gas. (a) On the can is the warning “Store only at temperatures below 120 °F (48.8 °C). Do not incinerate.” Why? (b) The gas in the can is initially at 24 °C and 360 kPa, and the can has a volume of 350 mL. If the can is left in a car that reaches 50 °C on a hot day, what is the new pressure in the can? Solution (a) The can contains an amount of isobutane gas at a constant volume, so if the temperature is increased by heating, the pressure will increase proportionately. High temperature could lead to high pressure, causing the can to burst. (Also, isobutane is combustible, so incineration could cause the can to explode.)

472 Chapter 9 | Gases (b) We are looking for a pressure change due to a temperature change at constant volume, so we will use Amontons’s/Gay-Lussac’s law. Taking P1 and T1 as the initial values, T2 as the temperature where the pressure is unknown and P2 as the unknown pressure, and converting °C to K, we have: P1 P2 P2 360 kPa = which means that = T1 T2 297 K 323 K 360 kPa × 323 K P2 = = 390 kPa Rearranging and solving gives: 297 K Check Your Learning A sample of nitrogen, N2, occupies 45.0 mL at 27 °C and 600 torr. What pressure will it have if cooled to –73 °C while the volume remains constant? Answer: 400 torr Volume and Temperature: Charles’s Law If we fill a balloon with air and seal it, the balloon contains a specific amount of air at atmospheric pressure, let’s say 1 atm. If we put the balloon in a refrigerator, the gas inside gets cold and the balloon shrinks (although both the amount of gas and its pressure remain constant). If we make the balloon very cold, it will shrink a great deal, and it expands again when it warms up.

These examples of the effect of temperature on the volume of a given amount of a confined gas at constant pressure are true in general: The volume increases as the temperature increases, and decreases as the temperature decreases.

Chapter 9 | Gases 473 Figure 9.12 The volume and temperature are linearly related for 1 mole of methane gas at a constant pressure of 1 atm. If the temperature is in kelvin, volume and temperature are directly proportional. The line stops at 111 K because methane liquefies at this temperature; when extrapolated, it intersects the graph’s origin, representing a temperature of absolute zero. The relationship between the volume and temperature of a given amount of gas at constant pressure is known as Charles’s law in recognition of the French scientist and balloon flight pioneer Jacques Alexandre César Charles. Charles’s law states that the volume of a given amount of gas is directly proportional to its temperature on the kelvin scale when the pressure is held constant. Mathematically, this can be written as: V α T or V = constant·T or V = k·T or V1 /T1 = V2 /T2 with k being a proportionality constant that depends on the amount and pressure of the gas. V For a confined, constant pressure gas sample, is constant (i.e., the ratio = k), and as seen with the V-T relationship, T V1 V2 = . this leads to another form of Charles’s law: T1 T2 Example 9.6 Predicting Change in Volume with Temperature A sample of carbon dioxide, CO2, occupies 0.300 L at 10 °C and 750 torr. What volume will the gas have at 30 °C and 750 torr? Solution Because we are looking for the volume change caused by a temperature change at constant pressure, this is a job for Charles’s law. Taking V1 and T1 as the initial values, T2 as the temperature at which the volume is unknown and V2 as the unknown volume, and converting °C into K we have: V1 V2 V2 0.300 L = which means that = T1 T2 283 K 303 K 0.300 L × 303 K V2 = = 0.321 L Rearranging and solving gives: 283 K

474 Chapter 9 | Gases This answer supports our expectation from Charles’s law, namely, that raising the gas temperature (from 283 K to 303 K) at a constant pressure will yield an increase in its volume (from 0.300 L to 0.321 L). Check Your Learning A sample of oxygen, O2, occupies 32.2 mL at 30 °C and 452 torr. What volume will it occupy at –70 °C and the same pressure? Answer: 21.6 mL Example 9.7 Measuring Temperature with a Volume Change Temperature is sometimes measured with a gas thermometer by observing the change in the volume of the gas as the temperature changes at constant pressure. The hydrogen in a particular hydrogen gas thermometer cm3 has a volume of 150.0 when immersed in a mixture of ice and water (0.00 °C). When immersed cm3. in boiling liquid ammonia, the volume of the hydrogen, at the same pressure, is 131.7 Find the temperature of boiling ammonia on the kelvin and Celsius scales. Solution A volume change caused by a temperature change at constant pressure means we should use Charles’s law. Taking V1 and T1 as the initial values, T2 as the temperature at which the volume is unknown and V2 as the unknown volume, and converting °C into K we have: V1 V2 cm3 cm3 150.0 131.7 = which means that = T1 T2 T2 273.15 K 3 131.7 cm × 273.15 K T2 = = 239.8 K Rearrangement gives 3 150.0 cm Subtracting 273.15 from 239.8 K, we find that the temperature of the boiling ammonia on the Celsius scale is –33.4 °C. Check Your Learning What is the volume of a sample of ethane at 467 K and 1.1 atm if it occupies 405 mL at 298 K and 1.1 atm? Answer: 635 mL Volume and Pressure: Boyle’s Law If we partially fill an airtight syringe with air, the syringe contains a specific amount of air at constant temperature, say 25 °C. If we slowly push in the plunger while keeping temperature constant, the gas in the syringe is compressed into a smaller volume and its pressure increases; if we pull out the plunger, the volume increases and the pressure decreases. This example of the effect of volume on the pressure of a given amount of a confined gas is true in general. Decreasing the volume of a contained gas will increase its pressure, and increasing its volume will decrease its pressure. In fact, if the volume increases by a certain factor, the pressure decreases by the same factor, and vice versa.

Chapter 9 | Gases 475 Figure 9.13 When a gas occupies a smaller volume, it exerts a higher pressure; when it occupies a larger volume, it exerts a lower pressure (assuming the amount of gas and the temperature do not change). Since P and V are 1 inversely proportional, a graph of vs. V is linear. P Unlike the P-T and V-T relationships, pressure and volume are not directly proportional to each other. Instead, P and V exhibit inverse proportionality: Increasing the pressure results in a decrease of the volume of the gas. Mathematically this can be written: P α 1/V or P = k·1/V or P·V = k or P1 V1 = P2 V2 with k being a constant. Graphically, this relationship is shown by the straight line that results when plotting the ⎛ ⎞ ⎛ ⎞ ⎝1 ⎝1 ⎠versus ⎠versus inverse of the pressure the volume (V), or the inverse of volume the pressure (V).

P The relationship between the volume and pressure of a given amount of gas at constant temperature was first published by the English natural philosopher Robert Boyle over 300 years ago. It is summarized in the statement now known as Boyle’s law: The volume of a given amount of gas held at constant temperature is inversely proportional to the pressure under which it is measured.

Solution (a) Estimating from the P-V graph gives a value for P somewhere around 27 psi. 1 (b) Estimating from the versus V graph give a value of about 26 psi. P (c) From Boyle’s law, we know that the product of pressure and volume (PV) for a given sample of gas at a constant temperature is always equal to the same value. Therefore we have P1V1 = k and P2V2 = k which means that P1V1 = P2V2. Using P1 and V1 as the known values 0.993 atm and 2.40 mL, P2 as the pressure at which the volume is unknown, and V2 as the unknown volume, we have: P1 V1 = P2 V2 or 13.0 psi × 15.0 mL = P2 × 7.5 mL Solving: 13.0 psi × 15.0 mL V2 = = 26 mL 7.5 mL https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

The answer, of course, is respiration, or breathing. How does it work? It turns out that the gas laws apply here. Your lungs take in gas that your body needs (oxygen) and get rid of waste gas (carbon dioxide). Lungs are made of spongy, stretchy tissue that expands and contracts while you breathe. When you inhale, your diaphragm and intercostal muscles (the muscles between your ribs) contract, expanding your chest cavity and making your lung volume larger. The increase in volume leads to a decrease in pressure (Boyle’s law). This causes air to flow into the lungs (from high pressure to low pressure). When you exhale, the process reverses: Your diaphragm and rib muscles relax, your chest cavity contracts, and your lung volume decreases, causing the pressure to increase (Boyle’s law again), and air flows out of the lungs (from high pressure to low pressure). You then breathe in and out again, and again, repeating this Boyle’s law cycle for the rest of your life (Figure 9.15). 

--- Page 486 ---
478 Chapter 9 | Gases Figure 9.15 Breathing occurs because expanding and contracting lung volume creates small pressure differences between your lungs and your surroundings, causing air to be drawn into and forced out of your lungs. Moles of Gas and Volume: Avogadro’s Law The Italian scientist Amedeo Avogadro advanced a hypothesis in 1811 to account for the behavior of gases, stating that equal volumes of all gases, measured under the same conditions of temperature and pressure, contain the same number of molecules. Over time, this relationship was supported by many experimental observations as expressed by Avogadro’s law: For a confined gas, the volume (V) and number of moles (n) are directly proportional if the pressure and temperature both remain constant. In equation form, this is written as: V1 V2 V ∝n or V = k × n or = n1 n2 Mathematical relationships can also be determined for the other variable pairs, such as P versus n, and n versus T. https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

Use the simulation to examine the effect of changing one parameter on another while holding the other parameters constant (as described in the preceding sections on the various gas laws). The Ideal Gas Law To this point, four separate laws have been discussed that relate pressure, volume, temperature, and the number of moles of the gas: Boyle’s law: PV = constant at constant T and n • P Amontons’s law: = constant at constant V and n • T V Charles’s law: = constant at constant P and n • T Vn Avogadro’s law: = constant at constant P and T • Combining these four laws yields the ideal gas law, a relation between the pressure, volume, temperature, and number of moles of a gas: PV = nRT where P is the pressure of a gas, V is its volume, n is the number of moles of the gas, T is its temperature on the kelvin scale, and R is a constant called the ideal gas constant or the universal gas constant. The units used to express pressure, volume, and temperature will determine the proper form of the gas constant as required by dimensional mol–1 K–1 mol–1 K–1. analysis, the most commonly encountered values being 0.08206 L atm and 8.314 kPa L Gases whose properties of P, V, and T are accurately described by the ideal gas law (or the other gas laws) are said to exhibit ideal behavior or to approximate the traits of an ideal gas. An ideal gas is a hypothetical construct that may be used along with kinetic molecular theory to effectively explain the gas laws as will be described in a later module of this chapter. Although all the calculations presented in this module assume ideal behavior, this assumption is only reasonable for gases under conditions of relatively low pressure and high temperature. In the final module of this chapter, a modified gas law will be introduced that accounts for the non-ideal behavior observed for many gases at relatively high pressures and low temperatures. The ideal gas equation contains five terms, the gas constant R and the variable properties P, V, n, and T. Specifying any four of these terms will permit use of the ideal gas law to calculate the fifth term as demonstrated in the following example exercises. Example 9.9 Using the Ideal Gas Law Methane, CH4, is being considered for use as an alternative automotive fuel to replace gasoline. One gallon of gasoline could be replaced by 655 g of CH4.

Answer: 0.538 L Chemistry in Everyday Life The Interdependence between Ocean Depth and Pressure in Scuba Diving Whether scuba diving at the Great Barrier Reef in Australia (shown in Figure 9.17) or in the Caribbean, divers must understand how pressure affects a number of issues related to their comfort and safety. Figure 9.17 Scuba divers, whether at the Great Barrier Reef or in the Caribbean, must be aware of buoyancy, pressure equalization, and the amount of time they spend underwater, to avoid the risks associated with pressurized gases in the body. (credit: Kyle Taylor) Pressure increases with ocean depth, and the pressure changes most rapidly as divers reach the surface. The pressure a diver experiences is the sum of all pressures above the diver (from the water and the air). Most pressure measurements are given in units of atmospheres, expressed as “atmospheres absolute” or ATA in the diving community: Every 33 feet of salt water represents 1 ATA of pressure in addition to 1 ATA of pressure

482 Chapter 9 | Gases from the atmosphere at sea level. As a diver descends, the increase in pressure causes the body’s air pockets in the ears and lungs to compress; on the ascent, the decrease in pressure causes these air pockets to expand, potentially rupturing eardrums or bursting the lungs. Divers must therefore undergo equalization by adding air to body airspaces on the descent by breathing normally and adding air to the mask by breathing out of the nose or adding air to the ears and sinuses by equalization techniques; the corollary is also true on ascent, divers must release air from the body to maintain equalization. Buoyancy, or the ability to control whether a diver sinks or floats, is controlled by the buoyancy compensator (BCD). If a diver is ascending, the air in his BCD expands because of lower pressure according to Boyle’s law (decreasing the pressure of gases increases the volume). The expanding air increases the buoyancy of the diver, and she or he begins to ascend. The diver must vent air from the BCD or risk an uncontrolled ascent that could rupture the lungs. In descending, the increased pressure causes the air in the BCD to compress and the diver sinks much more quickly; the diver must add air to the BCD or risk an uncontrolled descent, facing much higher pressures near the ocean floor. The pressure also impacts how long a diver can stay underwater before ascending. The deeper a diver dives, the more compressed the air that is breathed because of increased pressure: If a diver dives 33 feet, the pressure is 2 ATA and the air would be compressed to one-half of its original volume. The diver uses up available air twice as fast as at the surface. Standard Conditions of Temperature and Pressure We have seen that the volume of a given quantity of gas and the number of molecules (moles) in a given volume of gas vary with changes in pressure and temperature. Chemists sometimes make comparisons against a standard temperature and pressure (STP) for reporting properties of gases: 273.15 K and 1 atm (101.325 kPa). At STP, an (Figure 9.18). ideal gas has a volume of about 22.4 L—this is referred to as the standard molar volume Figure 9.18 Since the number of moles in a given volume of gas varies with pressure and temperature changes, chemists use standard temperature and pressure (273.15 K and 1 atm or 101.325 kPa) to report properties of gases. https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

He discovered the law of conservation of matter, discovered the role of oxygen in combustion reactions, determined the composition of air, explained respiration in terms of chemical reactions, and more. He was a casualty of the French Revolution, guillotined in 1794. Of his death, mathematician and astronomer Joseph-Louis Lagrange said, “It took the mob only it.”[1] a moment to remove his head; a century will not suffice to reproduce As described in an earlier chapter of this text, we can turn to chemical stoichiometry for answers to many of the questions that ask “How much?” We can answer the question with masses of substances or volumes of solutions. However, we can also answer this question another way: with volumes of gases. We can use the ideal gas equation to relate the pressure, volume, temperature, and number of moles of a gas. Here we will combine the ideal gas equation with other equations to find gas density and molar mass. We will deal with mixtures of different gases, and calculate amounts of substances in reactions involving gases. This section will not introduce any new material or ideas, but will provide examples of applications and ways to integrate concepts we have already discussed. Density of a Gas m ρ = . Recall that the density of a gas is its mass to volume ratio, Therefore, if we can determine the mass of V some volume of a gas, we will get its density.

Each individual gas in a mixture exerts the same pressure that it would exert if it present alone in the (Figure 9.20). container The pressure exerted by each individual gas in a mixture is called its partial pressure. This observation is summarized by Dalton’s law of partial pressures: The total pressure of a mixture of ideal gases is equal to the sum of the partial pressures of the component gases: PTotal = PA + PB + PC + ... = ΣiPi In the equation PTotal is the total pressure of a mixture of gases, PA is the partial pressure of gas A; PB is the partial pressure of gas B; PC is the partial pressure of gas C; and so on.

The partial pressure of gas A is related to the total pressure of the gas mixture via its mole fraction (X), a unit of concentration defined as the number of moles of a component of a solution divided by the total number of moles of all components): nA PA = XA × PTotal where XA = nTotal where PA, XA, and nA are the partial pressure, mole fraction, and number of moles of gas A, respectively, and nTotal is the number of moles of all components in the mixture.

Answer: 1.87 atm Collection of Gases over Water A simple way to collect gases that do not react with water is to capture them in a bottle that has been filled with water and inverted into a dish filled with water. The pressure of the gas inside the bottle can be made equal to the air pressure outside by raising or lowering the bottle. When the water level is the same both inside and outside the bottle (Figure 9.21), the pressure of the gas is equal to the atmospheric pressure, which can be measured with a barometer. Figure 9.21 When a reaction produces a gas that is collected above water, the trapped gas is a mixture of the gas produced by the reaction and water vapor. If the collection flask is appropriately positioned to equalize the water levels both within and outside the flask, the pressure of the trapped gas mixture will equal the atmospheric pressure outside the flask (see the earlier discussion of manometers). However, there is another factor we must consider when we measure the pressure of the gas by this method. Water evaporates and there is always gaseous water (water vapor) above a sample of liquid water. As a gas is collected over water, it becomes saturated with water vapor and the total pressure of the mixture equals the partial pressure of the gas plus the partial pressure of the water vapor. The pressure of the pure gas is therefore equal to the total pressure minus the pressure of the water vapor—this is referred to as the “dry” gas pressure, that is, the pressure of the gas only, without water vapor. The vapor pressure of water, which is the pressure exerted by water vapor in equilibrium (Figure 9.22); with liquid water in a closed container, depends on the temperature more detailed information on the https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

Solution According to Dalton’s law, the total pressure in the bottle (750 torr) is the sum of the partial pressure of argon and the partial pressure of gaseous water: PT = PAr + PH2 O Rearranging this equation to solve for the pressure of argon gives: PAr = PT −PH2 O (Appendix E), The pressure of water vapor above a sample of liquid water at 26 °C is 25.2 torr so: PAr = 750 torr −25.2 torr = 725 torr Check Your Learning A sample of oxygen collected over water at a temperature of 29.0 °C and a pressure of 764 torr has a volume of 0.560 L. What volume would the dry oxygen have under the same conditions of temperature and pressure? Answer: 734 torr Chemical Stoichiometry and Gases Chemical stoichiometry describes the quantitative relationships between reactants and products in chemical reactions. We have previously measured quantities of reactants and products using masses for solids and volumes in conjunction with the molarity for solutions; now we can also use gas volumes to indicate quantities. If we know the volume, pressure, and temperature of a gas, we can use the ideal gas equation to calculate how many moles of the gas are present. If we know how many moles of a gas are involved, we can calculate the volume of a gas at any temperature and pressure. Avogadro’s Law Revisited Sometimes we can take advantage of a simplifying feature of the stoichiometry of gases that solids and solutions do not exhibit: All gases that show ideal behavior contain the same number of molecules in the same volume (at the same temperature and pressure). Thus, the ratios of volumes of gases involved in a chemical reaction are given by the coefficients in the equation for the reaction, provided that the gas volumes are measured at the same temperature and pressure. We can extend Avogadro’s law (that the volume of a gas is directly proportional to the number of moles of the gas) to chemical reactions with gases: Gases combine, or react, in definite and simple proportions by volume, provided that all gas volumes are measured at the same temperature and pressure. For example, since nitrogen and hydrogen ⟶2NH3(g), N2(g) + 3H2(g) gases react to produce ammonia gas according to a given volume of nitrogen gas reacts with three times that volume of hydrogen gas to produce two times that volume of ammonia gas, if pressure and temperature remain constant. Figure 9.23. The explanation for this is illustrated in According to Avogadro’s law, equal volumes of gaseous N2, H2, and NH3, at the same temperature and pressure, contain the same number of molecules. Because one molecule of N2 reacts with three molecules of H2 to produce two molecules of NH3, the volume of H2 required is three times the volume of N2, and the volume of NH3 produced is two times the volume of N2. https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

Suppose that a volume of 683 billion cubic feet of gaseous ammonia, measured at 25 °C and 1 atm, was manufactured. What volume of H2(g), measured under the same conditions, was required to prepare this amount of ammonia by reaction with N2? ⟶2NH3(g) N2(g) + 3H2(g) Solution Because equal volumes of H2 and NH3 contain equal numbers of molecules and each three molecules of H2 that react produce two molecules of NH3, the ratio of the volumes of H2 and NH3 will be equal to 3:2. Two ft3, volumes of NH3, in this case in units of billion will be formed from three volumes of H2: ft3 3 billion H2 ft3 103 ft3 683 billion NH3 × = 1.02 × billion H2 ft3 2 billion NH3 ft3 ft3 The manufacture of 683 billion of NH3 required 1020 billion of H2.

In fact, this 1 is due to less than 0.5% of the air molecules. Of the energy from the sun that reaches the earth, almost 3 is reflected back into space, with the rest absorbed by the atmosphere and the surface of the earth. Some of the energy that the earth absorbs is re-emitted as infrared (IR) radiation, a portion of which passes back out through the atmosphere into space. However, most of this IR radiation is absorbed by certain substances in the atmosphere, known as greenhouse gases, which re-emit this energy in all directions, trapping some of the heat. This maintains favorable living conditions—without atmosphere, the average global average temperature of 14 °C (57 °F) would be about –19 °C (–2 °F). The major greenhouse gases (GHGs) are water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, and ozone. Since the Industrial Revolution, human activity has been increasing the concentrations of GHGs, which have changed the energy balance and are significantly altering the earth’s climate (Figure 9.24). Figure 9.24 Greenhouse gases trap enough of the sun’s energy to make the planet habitable—this is known as the greenhouse effect. Human activities are increasing greenhouse gas levels, warming the planet and causing more extreme weather events. There is strong evidence from multiple sources that higher atmospheric levels of CO2 are caused by human 3 activity, with fossil fuel burning accounting for about of the recent increase in CO2. Reliable data from ice 4 cores reveals that CO2 concentration in the atmosphere is at the highest level in the past 800,000 years; other evidence indicates that it may be at its highest level in 20 million years. In recent years, the CO2 concentration has increased from historical levels of below 300 ppm to almost 400 ppm today (Figure 9.25).

Although gaseous molecules travel at tremendous speeds (hundreds of meters per second), they collide with other gaseous molecules and travel in many different directions before reaching the desired target. At room temperature, a gaseous molecule will experience billions of collisions per second. The mean free path is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions. The mean free path increases with decreasing pressure; in general, the mean free path for a gaseous molecule will be hundreds of times the diameter of the molecule In general, we know that when a sample of gas is introduced to one part of a closed container, its molecules very quickly disperse throughout the container; this process by which molecules disperse in space in response to Figure 9.27). differences in concentration is called diffusion (shown in The gaseous atoms or molecules are, of course, unaware of any concentration gradient, they simply move randomly—regions of higher concentration have more particles than regions of lower concentrations, and so a net movement of species from high to low concentration areas takes place. In a closed environment, diffusion will ultimately result in equal concentrations of gas throughout, Figure 9.27. as depicted in The gaseous atoms and molecules continue to move, but since their concentrations are the same in both bulbs, the rates of transfer between the bulbs are equal (no net transfer of molecules occurs).

496 Chapter 9 | Gases Figure 9.27 (a) Two gases, H2 and O2, are initially separated. (b) When the stopcock is opened, they mix together. The lighter gas, H2, passes through the opening faster than O2, so just after the stopcock is opened, more H2 molecules move to the O2 side than O2 molecules move to the H2 side. (c) After a short time, both the slower-moving O2 molecules and the faster-moving H2 molecules have distributed themselves evenly on both sides of the vessel. We are often interested in the rate of diffusion, the amount of gas passing through some area per unit time: amount of gas passing through an area rate of diffusio = unit of time The diffusion rate depends on several factors: the concentration gradient (the increase or decrease in concentration from one point to another); the amount of surface area available for diffusion; and the distance the gas particles must travel. Note also that the time required for diffusion to occur is inversely proportional to the rate of diffusion, as shown in the rate of diffusion equation. A process involving movement of gaseous species similar to diffusion is effusion, the escape of gas molecules (Figure 9.28). through a tiny hole such as a pinhole in a balloon into a vacuum Although diffusion and effusion rates both depend on the molar mass of the gas involved, their rates are not equal; however, the ratios of their rates are the same. Figure 9.28 Diffusion occurs when gas molecules disperse throughout a container. Effusion occurs when a gas passes through an opening that is smaller than the mean free path of the particles, that is, the average distance traveled between collisions. Effectively, this means that only one particle passes through at a time. If a mixture of gases is placed in a container with porous walls, the gases effuse through the small openings in the (Figure walls. The lighter gases pass through the small openings more rapidly (at a higher rate) than the heavier ones 9.29). In 1832, Thomas Graham studied the rates of effusion of different gases and formulated Graham’s law of effusion: The rate of effusion of a gas is inversely proportional to the square root of the mass of its particles: 1 rate of effusio ∝ ℳ https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at 

--- Page 505 ---
Chapter 9 | Gases 497 This means that if two gases A and B are at the same temperature and pressure, the ratio of their effusion rates is inversely proportional to the ratio of the square roots of the masses of their particles: ℳB rate of effusion of = rate of effusion of ℳA Figure 9.29 A balloon filled with air (the blue one) remains full overnight. A balloon filled with helium (the green one) partially deflates because the smaller, light helium atoms effuse through small holes in the rubber much more readily than the heavier molecules of nitrogen and oxygen found in air.

Solution It is important to resist the temptation to use the times directly, and to remember how rate relates to time as well as how it relates to mass. Recall the definition of rate of effusion: amount of gas transferred rate of effusio = time and combine it with Graham’s law: ℳNe rate of effusion of as Xe = rate of effusion of as Ne ℳXe To get: amount of Xe transferred ℳNe time for Xe = amount of Ne transferred ℳXe time for Ne Noting that amount of A = amount of B, and solving for time for Ne: amount of Xe ℳNe ℳNe time for Ne time for Xe = = = time for Xe ℳXe ℳXe amount of Ne time for Ne and substitute values: 20.2 g mol time for Ne = = 0.392 243 s 131.3 g mol Finally, solve for the desired quantity: time for Ne = 0.392 × 243 s = 95.3 s Note that this answer is reasonable: Since Ne is lighter than Xe, the effusion rate for Ne will be larger than that for Xe, which means the time of effusion for Ne will be smaller than that for Xe.

Answer: 163 g/mol How Sciences Interconnect Use of Diffusion for Nuclear Energy Applications: Uranium Enrichment Gaseous diffusion has been used to produce enriched uranium for use in nuclear power plants and weapons. 235U, Naturally occurring uranium contains only 0.72% of the kind of uranium that is “fissile,” that is, capable 235U, of sustaining a nuclear fission chain reaction. Nuclear reactors require fuel that is 2–5% and nuclear bombs need even higher concentrations. One way to enrich uranium to the desired levels is to take advantage of Graham’s law. In a gaseous diffusion enrichment plant, uranium hexafluoride (UF6, the only uranium compound that is volatile enough to work) is slowly pumped through large cylindrical vessels called diffusers, which contain porous barriers with microscopic openings. The process is one of diffusion because the other 235UF6 side of the barrier is not evacuated. The molecules have a higher average speed and diffuse through 238UF6 the barrier a little faster than the heavier molecules. The gas that has passed through the barrier is 235UF6 slightly enriched in and the residual gas is slightly depleted. The small difference in molecular weights 235UF6 238UF6 between and only about 0.4% enrichment, is achieved in one diffuser (Figure 9.30). But by connecting many diffusers in a sequence of stages (called a cascade), the desired level of enrichment can be attained.

Although the theory is simple, this required surmounting many daunting technical challenges to 10–6 make it work in practice. The barrier must have tiny, uniform holes (about cm in diameter) and be porous enough to produce high flow rates. All materials (the barrier, tubing, surface coatings, lubricants, and gaskets) need to be able to contain, but not react with, the highly reactive and corrosive UF6. Because gaseous diffusion plants require very large amounts of energy (to compress the gas to the high pressures required and drive it through the diffuser cascade, to remove the heat produced during compression, and so on), it is now being replaced by gas centrifuge technology, which requires far less energy. A current hot political issue is how to deny this technology to Iran, to prevent it from producing enough enriched uranium for them to use to make nuclear weapons. 9.5 The Kinetic-Molecular Theory State the postulates of the kinetic-molecular theory • Use this theory’s postulates to explain the gas laws • The gas laws that we have seen to this point, as well as the ideal gas equation, are empirical, that is, they have been derived from experimental observations. The mathematical forms of these laws closely describe the macroscopic behavior of most gases at pressures less than about 1 or 2 atm. Although the gas laws describe relationships that have been verified by many experiments, they do not tell us why gases follow these relationships. The kinetic molecular theory (KMT) is a simple microscopic model that effectively explains the gas laws described in previous modules of this chapter. This theory is based on the following five postulates described here. (Note: The term “molecule” will be used to refer to the individual chemical species that compose the gas, although some gases are composed of atomic species, for example, the noble gases.) https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

Chapter 9 | Gases 501 Gases are composed of molecules that are in continuous motion, travelling in straight lines and changing 1. direction only when they collide with other molecules or with the walls of a container. The molecules composing the gas are negligibly small compared to the distances between them. 2. The pressure exerted by a gas in a container results from collisions between the gas molecules and the 3. container walls. Gas molecules exert no attractive or repulsive forces on each other or the container walls; therefore, their 4. collisions are elastic (do not involve a loss of energy). The average kinetic energy of the gas molecules is proportional to the kelvin temperature of the gas. 5. The test of the KMT and its postulates is its ability to explain and describe the behavior of a gas. The various gas laws can be derived from the assumptions of the KMT, which have led chemists to believe that the assumptions of the theory accurately represent the properties of gas molecules. We will first look at the individual gas laws (Boyle’s, Charles’s, Amontons’s, Avogadro’s, and Dalton’s laws) conceptually to see how the KMT explains them. Then, we will more carefully consider the relationships between molecular masses, speeds, and kinetic energies with temperature, and explain Graham’s law. The Kinetic-Molecular Theory Explains the Behavior of Gases, Part I Recalling that gas pressure is exerted by rapidly moving gas molecules and depends directly on the number of molecules hitting a unit area of the wall per unit of time, we see that the KMT conceptually explains the behavior of a gas as follows: Amontons’s law. If the temperature is increased, the average speed and kinetic energy of the gas molecules • increase. If the volume is held constant, the increased speed of the gas molecules results in more frequent and (Figure 9.31). more forceful collisions with the walls of the container, therefore increasing the pressure Charles’s law. If the temperature of a gas is increased, a constant pressure may be maintained only if the • volume occupied by the gas increases. This will result in greater average distances traveled by the molecules to reach the container walls, as well as increased wall surface area. These conditions will decrease the both the frequency of molecule-wall collisions and the number of collisions per unit area, the combined effects of which outweigh those of increased collision forces due to the greater kinetic energy at the higher temperature. The net result is a decrease in gas pressure. Boyle’s law. If the gas volume is decreased, the container wall area decreases and the molecule-wall collision • (Figure 9.31). frequency increases, both of which increase the pressure exerted by the gas Avogadro’s law. At constant pressure and temperature, the frequency and force of molecule-wall collisions • are constant. Under such conditions, increasing the number of gaseous molecules will require a proportional increase in the container volume in order to yield a decrease in the number of collisions per unit area to (Figure 9.31). compensate for the increased frequency of collisions Dalton’s Law. Because of the large distances between them, the molecules of one gas in a mixture bombard • the container walls with the same frequency whether other gases are present or not, and the total pressure of a gas mixture equals the sum of the (partial) pressures of the individual gases.

502 Chapter 9 | Gases Figure 9.31 (a) When gas temperature increases, gas pressure increases due to increased force and frequency of molecular collisions. (b) When volume decreases, gas pressure increases due to reduced frequency of molecular collisions. (c) When the amount of gas increases at a constant pressure, volume increases to yield a constant number of collisions per unit wall area. Molecular Velocities and Kinetic Energy The previous discussion showed that the KMT qualitatively explains the behaviors described by the various gas laws. The postulates of this theory may be applied in a more quantitative fashion to derive these individual laws. To do this, we must first look at velocities and kinetic energies of gas molecules, and the temperature of a gas sample. In a gas sample, individual molecules have widely varying speeds; however, because of the vast number of molecules and collisions involved, the molecular speed distribution and average speed are constant. This molecular speed distribution is known as a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, and it depicts the relative numbers of molecules in a bulk (Figure 9.32). sample of gas that possesses a given speed https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

Chapter 9 | Gases 503 Figure 9.32 The molecular speed distribution for oxygen gas at 300 K is shown here. Very few molecules move at either very low or very high speeds. The number of molecules with intermediate speeds increases rapidly up to a maximum, which is the most probable speed, then drops off rapidly. Note that the most probable speed, νp, is a little less than 400 m/s, while the root mean square speed, urms, is closer to 500 m/s. The kinetic energy (KE) of a particle of mass (m) and speed (u) is given by: 1 mu2 KE = 2 m2 Expressing mass in kilograms and speed in meters per second will yield energy values in units of joules (J = kg s–2). To deal with a large number of gas molecules, we use averages for both speed and kinetic energy. In the KMT, the root mean square velocity of a particle, urms, is defined as the square root of the average of the squares of the velocities with n = the number of particles: 2 2 2 2 u1 + u2 + u3 + u4 + … u2 urms = = n The average kinetic energy, KEavg, is then equal to: 1 2 KEavg = 2murms The KEavg of a collection of gas molecules is also directly proportional to the temperature of the gas and may be described by the equation: 3 KEavg = RT 2 where R is the gas constant and T is the kelvin temperature.

Answer: 441 m/s If the temperature of a gas increases, its KEavg increases, more molecules have higher speeds and fewer molecules have lower speeds, and the distribution shifts toward higher speeds overall, that is, to the right. If temperature decreases, KEavg decreases, more molecules have lower speeds and fewer molecules have higher speeds, and the distribution shifts toward lower speeds overall, that is, to the left. This behavior is illustrated for nitrogen gas in Figure 9.33. Figure 9.33 The molecular speed distribution for nitrogen gas (N2) shifts to the right and flattens as the temperature increases; it shifts to the left and heightens as the temperature decreases.

Examine the simulator’s “energy histograms” (molecular speed distributions) and “species information” (which gives average speed values) for molecules of different masses at various temperatures. The Kinetic-Molecular Theory Explains the Behavior of Gases, Part II According to Graham’s law, the molecules of a gas are in rapid motion and the molecules themselves are small. The average distance between the molecules of a gas is large compared to the size of the molecules. As a consequence, gas molecules can move past each other easily and diffuse at relatively fast rates. The rate of effusion of a gas depends directly on the (average) speed of its molecules: effusion ate ∝urms Using this relation, and the equation relating molecular speed to mass, Graham’s law may be easily derived as shown here: 3RT urms = m 3RT 3RT m = = u¯ 2 2 urms 3RT urms mB mA effusion ate A A = = = urms mA effusion ate B B 3RT mB The ratio of the rates of effusion is thus derived to be inversely proportional to the ratio of the square roots of their masses. This is the same relation observed experimentally and expressed as Graham’s law.

506 Chapter 9 | Gases 9.6 Non-Ideal Gas Behavior By the end of this section, you will be able to: Describe the physical factors that lead to deviations from ideal gas behavior • Explain how these factors are represented in the van der Waals equation • Define compressibility (Z) and describe how its variation with pressure reflects non-ideal behavior • Quantify non-ideal behavior by comparing computations of gas properties using the ideal gas law and • the van der Waals equation Thus far, the ideal gas law, PV = nRT, has been applied to a variety of different types of problems, ranging from reaction stoichiometry and empirical and molecular formula problems to determining the density and molar mass of a gas. As mentioned in the previous modules of this chapter, however, the behavior of a gas is often non-ideal, meaning that the observed relationships between its pressure, volume, and temperature are not accurately described by the gas laws. In this section, the reasons for these deviations from ideal gas behavior are considered. One way in which the accuracy of PV = nRT can be judged is by comparing the actual volume of 1 mole of gas (its molar volume, Vm) to the molar volume of an ideal gas at the same temperature and pressure. This ratio is called the compressibility factor (Z) with: ⎛ ⎞ molar volume of gas at same T and P PVm ⎝ ⎠measured Z = = RT molar volume of ideal gas at same T and P Ideal gas behavior is therefore indicated when this ratio is equal to 1, and any deviation from 1 is an indication of Figure 9.35 non-ideal behavior. shows plots of Z over a large pressure range for several common gases. Figure 9.35 A graph of the compressibility factor (Z) vs. pressure shows that gases can exhibit significant deviations from the behavior predicted by the ideal gas law. Figure 9.35, As is apparent from the ideal gas law does not describe gas behavior well at relatively high pressures. To determine why this is, consider the differences between real gas properties and what is expected of a hypothetical ideal gas. https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

Chapter 9 | Gases 507 Particles of a hypothetical ideal gas have no significant volume and do not attract or repel each other. In general, real gases approximate this behavior at relatively low pressures and high temperatures. However, at high pressures, the molecules of a gas are crowded closer together, and the amount of empty space between the molecules is reduced. At these higher pressures, the volume of the gas molecules themselves becomes appreciable relative to the total (Figure 9.36). volume occupied by the gas The gas therefore becomes less compressible at these high pressures, and although its volume continues to decrease with increasing pressure, this decrease is not proportional as predicted by Boyle’s law. Figure 9.36 Raising the pressure of a gas increases the fraction of its volume that is occupied by the gas molecules and makes the gas less compressible. At relatively low pressures, gas molecules have practically no attraction for one another because they are (on average) so far apart, and they behave almost like particles of an ideal gas. At higher pressures, however, the force of attraction is also no longer insignificant. This force pulls the molecules a little closer together, slightly decreasing the pressure (Figure 9.37). (if the volume is constant) or decreasing the volume (at constant pressure) This change is more pronounced at low temperatures because the molecules have lower KE relative to the attractive forces, and so they are less effective in overcoming these attractions after colliding with one another. 

--- Page 516 ---
508 Chapter 9 | Gases Figure 9.37 (a) Attractions between gas molecules serve to decrease the gas volume at constant pressure compared to an ideal gas whose molecules experience no attractive forces. (b) These attractive forces will decrease the force of collisions between the molecules and container walls, therefore reducing the pressure exerted compared to an ideal gas. There are several different equations that better approximate gas behavior than does the ideal gas law. The first, and simplest, of these was developed by the Dutch scientist Johannes van der Waals in 1879. The van der Waals equation improves upon the ideal gas law by adding two terms: one to account for the volume of the gas molecules and another for the attractive forces between them. The constant a corresponds to the strength of the attraction between molecules of a particular gas, and the constant b corresponds to the size of the molecules of a particular gas. The “correction” to the pressure term in the ideal gas n2 a , and n is relatively small, law is and the “correction” to the volume is nb. Note that when V is relatively large 2 V both of these correction terms become negligible, and the van der Waals equation reduces to the ideal gas law, PV = nRT. Such a condition corresponds to a gas in which a relatively low number of molecules is occupying a relatively large volume, that is, a gas at a relatively low pressure. Experimental values for the van der Waals constants of some Table 9.3. common gases are given in Values of van der Waals Constants for Some Common Gases (L2 atm/mol2) Gas a b (L/mol) N2 1.39 0.0391 O2 1.36 0.0318 CO2 3.59 0.0427 Table 9.3 https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

At high pressures and small volumes, the correction for the volume of the molecules becomes important because the molecules themselves are incompressible and constitute an appreciable fraction of the total volume. At some intermediate pressure, the two corrections have opposing influences and the gas appears to follow the relationship given by PV = nRT over a small range of pressures. This behavior is reflected by the “dips” in several of the Figure 9.35. compressibility curves shown in The attractive force between molecules initially makes the gas more compressible than an ideal gas, as pressure is raised (Z decreases with increasing P). At very high pressures, the gas becomes less compressible (Z increases with P), as the gas molecules begin to occupy an increasingly significant fraction of the total gas volume. Strictly speaking, the ideal gas equation functions well when intermolecular attractions between gas molecules are negligible and the gas molecules themselves do not occupy an appreciable part of the whole volume. These criteria are satisfied under conditions of low pressure and high temperature. Under such conditions, the gas is said to behave ideally, and deviations from the gas laws are small enough that they may be disregarded—this is, however, very often not the case.

Chapter 9 | Gases 513 Summary 9.1 Gas Pressure Gases exert pressure, which is force per unit area. The pressure of a gas may be expressed in the SI unit of pascal or kilopascal, as well as in many other units including torr, atmosphere, and bar. Atmospheric pressure is measured using a barometer; other gas pressures can be measured using one of several types of manometers. 9.2 Relating Pressure, Volume, Amount, and Temperature: The Ideal Gas Law The behavior of gases can be described by several laws based on experimental observations of their properties. The pressure of a given amount of gas is directly proportional to its absolute temperature, provided that the volume does not change (Amontons’s law). The volume of a given gas sample is directly proportional to its absolute temperature at constant pressure (Charles’s law). The volume of a given amount of gas is inversely proportional to its pressure when temperature is held constant (Boyle’s law). Under the same conditions of temperature and pressure, equal volumes of all gases contain the same number of molecules (Avogadro’s law). The equations describing these laws are special cases of the ideal gas law, PV = nRT, where P is the pressure of the gas, V is its volume, n is the number of moles of the gas, T is its kelvin temperature, and R is the ideal (universal) gas constant. 9.3 Stoichiometry of Gaseous Substances, Mixtures, and Reactions The ideal gas law can be used to derive a number of convenient equations relating directly measured quantities to properties of interest for gaseous substances and mixtures. Appropriate rearrangement of the ideal gas equation may be made to permit the calculation of gas densities and molar masses. Dalton’s law of partial pressures may be used to relate measured gas pressures for gaseous mixtures to their compositions. Avogadro’s law may be used in stoichiometric computations for chemical reactions involving gaseous reactants or products. 9.4 Effusion and Diffusion of Gases Gaseous atoms and molecules move freely and randomly through space. Diffusion is the process whereby gaseous atoms and molecules are transferred from regions of relatively high concentration to regions of relatively low concentration. Effusion is a similar process in which gaseous species pass from a container to a vacuum through very small orifices. The rates of effusion of gases are inversely proportional to the square roots of their densities or to the square roots of their atoms/molecules’ masses (Graham’s law). 9.5 The Kinetic-Molecular Theory The kinetic molecular theory is a simple but very effective model that effectively explains ideal gas behavior. The theory assumes that gases consist of widely separated molecules of negligible volume that are in constant motion, colliding elastically with one another and the walls of their container with average velocities determined by their absolute temperatures. The individual molecules of a gas exhibit a range of velocities, the distribution of these velocities being dependent on the temperature of the gas and the mass of its molecules. 9.6 Non-Ideal Gas Behavior Gas molecules possess a finite volume and experience forces of attraction for one another. Consequently, gas behavior is not necessarily described well by the ideal gas law. Under conditions of low pressure and high temperature, these factors are negligible, the ideal gas equation is an accurate description of gas behavior, and the gas is said to exhibit ideal behavior. However, at lower temperatures and higher pressures, corrections for molecular volume and molecular attractions are required to account for finite molecular size and attractive forces. The van der Waals equation is a modified version of the ideal gas law that can be used to account for the non-ideal behavior of gases under conditions. Exercises 9.1 Gas Pressure 1.

As described in the final module of the chapter on gases, this situation changes at high pressures and low temperatures—conditions that permit the atoms and molecules to interact to a much greater extent. In the liquid and solid states, these interactions are of considerable strength and play an important role in determining a number of physical properties that do depend on the chemical identity of the substance. In this chapter, the nature of these interactions and their effects on various physical properties of liquid and solid phases will be examined.

526 Chapter 10 | Liquids and Solids 10.1 Intermolecular Forces By the end of this section, you will be able to: Describe the types of intermolecular forces possible between atoms or molecules in condensed phases • (dispersion forces, dipole-dipole attractions, and hydrogen bonding) Identify the types of intermolecular forces experienced by specific molecules based on their • structures Explain the relation between the intermolecular forces present within a substance and the • temperatures associated with changes in its physical state As was the case for gaseous substances, the kinetic molecular theory may be used to explain the behavior of solids and liquids. In the following description, the term particle will be used to refer to an atom, molecule, or ion. Note that we will use the popular phrase “intermolecular attraction” to refer to attractive forces between the particles of a substance, regardless of whether these particles are molecules, atoms, or ions. Consider these two aspects of the molecular-level environments in solid, liquid, and gaseous matter: Particles in a solid are tightly packed together and often arranged in a regular pattern; in a liquid, they are • close together with no regular arrangement; in a gas, they are far apart with no regular arrangement. Particles in a solid vibrate about fixed positions and do not generally move in relation to one another; in a • liquid, they move past each other but remain in essentially constant contact; in a gas, they move independently of one another except when they collide. The differences in the properties of a solid, liquid, or gas reflect the strengths of the attractive forces between the atoms, molecules, or ions that make up each phase. The phase in which a substance exists depends on the relative extents of its intermolecular forces (IMFs) and the kinetic energies (KE) of its molecules. IMFs are the various forces of attraction that may exist between the atoms and molecules of a substance due to electrostatic phenomena, as will be detailed in this module. These forces serve to hold particles close together, whereas the particles’ KE provides Figure 10.2 the energy required to overcome the attractive forces and thus increase the distance between particles. illustrates how changes in physical state may be induced by changing the temperature, hence, the average KE, of a given substance. https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

Chapter 10 | Liquids and Solids 527 Figure 10.2 Transitions between solid, liquid, and gaseous states of a substance occur when conditions of temperature or pressure favor the associated changes in intermolecular forces. (Note: The space between particles in the gas phase is much greater than shown.) As an example of the processes depicted in this figure, consider a sample of water. When gaseous water is cooled sufficiently, the attractions between H2O molecules will be capable of holding them together when they come into contact with each other; the gas condenses, forming liquid H2O. For example, liquid water forms on the outside of a Figure 10.3. cold glass as the water vapor in the air is cooled by the cold glass, as seen in Figure 10.3 Condensation forms when water vapor in the air is cooled enough to form liquid water, such as (a) on the outside of a cold beverage glass or (b) in the form of fog. (credit a: modification of work by Jenny Downing; credit b: modification of work by Cory Zanker) We can also liquefy many gases by compressing them, if the temperature is not too high. The increased pressure brings the molecules of a gas closer together, such that the attractions between the molecules become strong relative to their KE. Consequently, they form liquids. Butane, C4H10, is the fuel used in disposable lighters and is a gas at standard temperature and pressure. Inside the lighter’s fuel compartment, the butane is compressed to a pressure that Figure 10.4. results in its condensation to the liquid state, as shown in

(credit: modification of work by “Sam-Cat”/Flickr) Finally, if the temperature of a liquid becomes sufficiently low, or the pressure on the liquid becomes sufficiently high, the molecules of the liquid no longer have enough KE to overcome the IMF between them, and a solid forms. A more thorough discussion of these and other changes of state, or phase transitions, is provided in a later module of this chapter. Link to Learning Access this interactive simulation (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/16phetvisual) on states of matter, phase transitions, and intermolecular forces. This simulation is useful for visualizing concepts introduced throughout this chapter. Forces between Molecules Under appropriate conditions, the attractions between all gas molecules will cause them to form liquids or solids. This is due to intermolecular forces, not intramolecular forces. Intramolecular forces are those within the molecule that keep the molecule together, for example, the bonds between the atoms. Intermolecular forces are the attractions Figure 10.5 between molecules, which determine many of the physical properties of a substance. illustrates these different molecular forces. The strengths of these attractive forces vary widely, though usually the IMFs between small molecules are weak compared to the intramolecular forces that bond atoms together within a molecule. For example, to overcome the IMFs in one mole of liquid HCl and convert it into gaseous HCl requires only about 17 kilojoules. However, to break the covalent bonds between the hydrogen and chlorine atoms in one mole of HCl requires about 25 times more energy—430 kilojoules. https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

Chapter 10 | Liquids and Solids 529 Figure 10.5 Intramolecular forces keep a molecule intact. Intermolecular forces hold multiple molecules together and determine many of a substance’s properties. All of the attractive forces between neutral atoms and molecules are known as van der Waals forces, although they are usually referred to more informally as intermolecular attraction. We will consider the various types of IMFs in the next three sections of this module. Dispersion Forces One of the three van der Waals forces is present in all condensed phases, regardless of the nature of the atoms or molecules composing the substance. This attractive force is called the London dispersion force in honor of German- born American physicist Fritz London who, in 1928, first explained it. This force is often referred to as simply the dispersion force. Because the electrons of an atom or molecule are in constant motion (or, alternatively, the electron’s location is subject to quantum-mechanical variability), at any moment in time, an atom or molecule can develop a temporary, instantaneous dipole if its electrons are distributed asymmetrically. The presence of this dipole can, in turn, distort the electrons of a neighboring atom or molecule, producing an induced dipole. These two rapidly fluctuating, temporary dipoles thus result in a relatively weak electrostatic attraction between the species—a so-called Figure 10.6. dispersion force like that illustrated in Figure 10.6 Dispersion forces result from the formation of temporary dipoles, as illustrated here for two nonpolar diatomic molecules. Dispersion forces that develop between atoms in different molecules can attract the two molecules to each other. The forces are relatively weak, however, and become significant only when the molecules are very close. Larger and heavier atoms and molecules exhibit stronger dispersion forces than do smaller and lighter atoms and molecules. F2 and Cl2 are gases at room temperature (reflecting weaker attractive forces); Br2 is a liquid, and I2 is a solid (reflecting stronger attractive forces). Trends in observed melting and boiling points for the halogens clearly demonstrate this Table 10.1. effect, as seen in

In a larger atom, the valence electrons are, on average, farther from the nuclei than in a smaller atom. Thus, they are less tightly held and can more easily form the temporary dipoles that produce the attraction. The measure of how easy or difficult it is for another electrostatic charge (for example, a nearby ion or polar molecule) to distort a molecule’s charge distribution (its electron cloud) is known as polarizability. A molecule that has a charge cloud that is easily distorted is said to be very polarizable and will have large dispersion forces; one with a charge cloud that is difficult to distort is not very polarizable and will have small dispersion forces. Example 10.1 London Forces and Their Effects Order the following compounds of a group 14 element and hydrogen from lowest to highest boiling point: CH4, SiH4, GeH4, and SnH4. Explain your reasoning. Solution Applying the skills acquired in the chapter on chemical bonding and molecular geometry, all of these compounds are predicted to be nonpolar, so they may experience only dispersion forces: the smaller the molecule, the less polarizable and the weaker the dispersion forces; the larger the molecule, the larger the dispersion forces. The molar masses of CH4, SiH4, GeH4, and SnH4 are approximately 16 g/mol, 32 g/mol, 77 g/mol, and 123 g/mol, respectively. Therefore, CH4 is expected to have the lowest boiling point and SnH4 the highest boiling point. The ordering from lowest to highest boiling point is expected to be CH4 < SiH4 < GeH4 < SnH4. A graph of the actual boiling points of these compounds versus the period of the group 14 element shows this prediction to be correct: https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

Chapter 10 | Liquids and Solids 531 Check Your Learning Order the following hydrocarbons from lowest to highest boiling point: C2H6, C3H8, and C4H10. Answer: C2H6 < C3H8 < C4H10. All of these compounds are nonpolar and only have London dispersion forces: the larger the molecule, the larger the dispersion forces and the higher the boiling point. The ordering from lowest to highest boiling point is therefore C2H6 < C3H8 < C4H10. The shapes of molecules also affect the magnitudes of the dispersion forces between them. For example, boiling Figure 10.7) points for the isomers n-pentane, isopentane, and neopentane (shown in are 36 °C, 27 °C, and 9.5 °C, respectively. Even though these compounds are composed of molecules with the same chemical formula, C5H12, the difference in boiling points suggests that dispersion forces in the liquid phase are different, being greatest for n-pentane and least for neopentane. The elongated shape of n-pentane provides a greater surface area available for contact between molecules, resulting in correspondingly stronger dispersion forces. The more compact shape of isopentane offers a smaller surface area available for intermolecular contact and, therefore, weaker dispersion forces. Neopentane molecules are the most compact of the three, offering the least available surface area for intermolecular contact and, hence, the weakest dispersion forces. This behavior is analogous to the connections that may be formed between strips of VELCRO brand fasteners: the greater the area of the strip’s contact, the stronger the connection.

Chemistry in Everyday Life Geckos and Intermolecular Forces Geckos have an amazing ability to adhere to most surfaces. They can quickly run up smooth walls and across ceilings that have no toe-holds, and they do this without having suction cups or a sticky substance on their toes. And while a gecko can lift its feet easily as it walks along a surface, if you attempt to pick it up, it sticks to the surface. How are geckos (as well as spiders and some other insects) able to do this? Although this phenomenon has been investigated for hundreds of years, scientists only recently uncovered the details of the process that allows geckos’ feet to behave this way. Geckos’ toes are covered with hundreds of thousands of tiny hairs known as setae, with each seta, in turn, branching into hundreds of tiny, flat, triangular tips called spatulae. The huge numbers of spatulae on its setae provide a gecko, shown in Figure 10.8, with a large total surface area for sticking to a surface. In 2000, Kellar Autumn, who leads a multi-institutional gecko research team, found that geckos adhered equally well to both polar silicon dioxide and nonpolar gallium arsenide. This proved that geckos stick to surfaces because of dispersion forces—weak intermolecular attractions arising from temporary, synchronized charge distributions between adjacent molecules. Although dispersion forces are very weak, the total attraction over millions of spatulae is large enough to support many times the gecko’s weight. In 2014, two scientists developed a model to explain how geckos can rapidly transition from “sticky” to “non- sticky.” Alex Greaney and Congcong Hu at Oregon State University described how geckos can achieve this by changing the angle between their spatulae and the surface. Geckos’ feet, which are normally nonsticky, become sticky when a small shear force is applied. By curling and uncurling their toes, geckos can alternate between sticking and unsticking from a surface, and thus easily move across it. Further investigations may eventually lead to the development of better adhesives and other applications. https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

Geckos adhere to surfaces because of van der Waals attractions between the surface and a gecko’s millions of spatulae. By changing how the spatulae contact the surface, geckos can turn their stickiness “on” and “off.” (credit photo: modification of work by “JC*+A!”/Flickr) Link to Learning Watch this video (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/16kellaraut) to learn more about Kellar Autumn’s research that determined that van der Waals forces are responsible for a gecko’s ability to cling and climb. Dipole-Dipole Attractions Recall from the chapter on chemical bonding and molecular geometry that polar molecules have a partial positive charge on one side and a partial negative charge on the other side of the molecule—a separation of charge called a dipole. Consider a polar molecule such as hydrogen chloride, HCl. In the HCl molecule, the more electronegative Cl atom bears the partial negative charge, whereas the less electronegative H atom bears the partial positive charge. An attractive force between HCl molecules results from the attraction between the positive end of one HCl molecule and the negative end of another. This attractive force is called a dipole-dipole attraction—the electrostatic force between Figure the partially positive end of one polar molecule and the partially negative end of another, as illustrated in 10.9. Figure 10.9 This image shows two arrangements of polar molecules, such as HCl, that allow an attraction between the partial negative end of one molecule and the partial positive end of another. 

--- Page 542 ---
534 Chapter 10 | Liquids and Solids The effect of a dipole-dipole attraction is apparent when we compare the properties of HCl molecules to nonpolar F2 molecules. Both HCl and F2 consist of the same number of atoms and have approximately the same molecular mass. At a temperature of 150 K, molecules of both substances would have the same average KE. However, the dipole- dipole attractions between HCl molecules are sufficient to cause them to “stick together” to form a liquid, whereas the relatively weaker dispersion forces between nonpolar F2 molecules are not, and so this substance is gaseous at this temperature. The higher normal boiling point of HCl (188 K) compared to F2 (85 K) is a reflection of the greater strength of dipole-dipole attractions between HCl molecules, compared to the attractions between nonpolar F2 molecules. We will often use values such as boiling or freezing points, or enthalpies of vaporization or fusion, as indicators of the relative strengths of IMFs of attraction present within different substances. Example 10.2 Dipole-Dipole Forces and Their Effects Predict which will have the higher boiling point: N2 or CO. Explain your reasoning. Solution CO and N2 are both diatomic molecules with masses of about 28 amu, so they experience similar London dispersion forces. Because CO is a polar molecule, it experiences dipole-dipole attractions. Because N2 is nonpolar, its molecules cannot exhibit dipole-dipole attractions. The dipole-dipole attractions between CO molecules are comparably stronger than the dispersion forces between nonpolar N2 molecules, so CO is expected to have the higher boiling point. Check Your Learning Predict which will have the higher boiling point: ICl or Br2. Explain your reasoning. Answer: ICl. ICl and Br2 have similar masses (~160 amu) and therefore experience similar London dispersion forces. ICl is polar and thus also exhibits dipole-dipole attractions; Br2 is nonpolar and does not. The relatively stronger dipole-dipole attractions require more energy to overcome, so ICl will have the higher boiling point. Hydrogen Bonding Nitrosyl fluoride (ONF, molecular mass 49 amu) is a gas at room temperature. Water (H2O, molecular mass 18 amu) is a liquid, even though it has a lower molecular mass. We clearly cannot attribute this difference between the two compounds to dispersion forces. Both molecules have about the same shape and ONF is the heavier and larger molecule. It is, therefore, expected to experience more significant dispersion forces. Additionally, we cannot attribute this difference in boiling points to differences in the dipole moments of the molecules. Both molecules are polar and exhibit comparable dipole moments. The large difference between the boiling points is due to a particularly strong dipole-dipole attraction that may occur when a molecule contains a hydrogen atom bonded to a fluorine, oxygen, or nitrogen atom (the three most electronegative elements). The very large difference in electronegativity between the H atom (2.1) and the atom to which it is bonded (4.0 for an F atom, 3.5 for an O atom, or 3.0 for a N atom), combined with the very small size of a H atom and the relatively small sizes of F, O, or N atoms, leads to highly concentrated partial charges with these atoms. Molecules with F-H, O-H, or N-H moieties are very strongly attracted to similar moieties in nearby molecules, a particularly strong type of dipole-dipole attraction called H3N⋯HNH2, HF⋯HF, H2O⋯HOH, and in which the hydrogen bonding.

Chapter 10 | Liquids and Solids 535 Figure 10.10 Water molecules participate in multiple hydrogen-bonding interactions with nearby water molecules. Despite use of the word “bond,” keep in mind that hydrogen bonds are intermolecular attractive forces, not intramolecular attractive forces (covalent bonds). Hydrogen bonds are much weaker than covalent bonds, only about 5 to 10% as strong, but are generally much stronger than other dipole-dipole attractions and dispersion forces. Hydrogen bonds have a pronounced effect on the properties of condensed phases (liquids and solids). For example, consider the trends in boiling points for the binary hydrides of group 15 (NH3, PH3, AsH3, and SbH3), group 16 hydrides (H2O, H2S, H2Se, and H2Te), and group 17 hydrides (HF, HCl, HBr, and HI). The boiling points of the Figure 10.11. heaviest three hydrides for each group are plotted in As we progress down any of these groups, the polarities of the molecules decrease slightly, whereas the sizes of the molecules increase substantially. The effect of increasingly stronger dispersion forces dominates that of increasingly weaker dipole-dipole attractions, and the boiling points are observed to increase steadily. 

--- Page 544 ---
536 Chapter 10 | Liquids and Solids Figure 10.11 For the group 15, 16, and 17 hydrides, the boiling points for each class of compounds increase with increasing molecular mass for elements in periods 3, 4, and 5. If we use this trend to predict the boiling points for the lightest hydride for each group, we would expect NH3 to boil at about −120 °C, H2O to boil at about −80 °C, and HF to boil at about −110 °C. However, when we measure the boiling points for these compounds, we find that they are dramatically higher than the trends would predict, as shown Figure 10.12. in The stark contrast between our naïve predictions and reality provides compelling evidence for the strength of hydrogen bonding. https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

Chapter 10 | Liquids and Solids 537 Figure 10.12 In comparison to periods 3−5, the binary hydrides of period 2 elements in groups 17, 16 and 15 (F, O and N, respectively) exhibit anomalously high boiling points due to hydrogen bonding. Example 10.3 Effect of Hydrogen Bonding on Boiling Points Consider the compounds dimethylether (CH3OCH3), ethanol (CH3CH2OH), and propane (CH3CH2CH3). Their boiling points, not necessarily in order, are −42.1 °C, −24.8 °C, and 78.4 °C. Match each compound with its boiling point. Explain your reasoning. Solution The VSEPR-predicted shapes of CH3OCH3, CH3CH2OH, and CH3CH2CH3 are similar, as are their molar masses (46 g/mol, 46 g/mol, and 44 g/mol, respectively), so they will exhibit similar dispersion forces. Since CH3CH2CH3 is nonpolar, it may exhibit only dispersion forces. Because CH3OCH3 is polar, it will also experience dipole-dipole attractions. Finally, CH3CH2OH has an −OH group, and so it will experience the uniquely strong dipole-dipole attraction known as hydrogen bonding. So the ordering in terms of strength of IMFs, and thus boiling points, is CH3CH2CH3 < CH3OCH3 < CH3CH2OH. The boiling point of propane is −42.1 °C, the boiling point of dimethylether is −24.8 °C, and the boiling point of ethanol is 78.5 °C. Check Your Learning Ethane (CH3CH3) has a melting point of −183 °C and a boiling point of −89 °C. Predict the melting and boiling points for methylamine (CH3NH2). Explain your reasoning. Answer: The melting point and boiling point for methylamine are predicted to be significantly greater than those of ethane. CH3CH3 and CH3NH2 are similar in size and mass, but methylamine possesses an −NH group and therefore may exhibit hydrogen bonding. This greatly increases its IMFs, and therefore its melting

How Sciences Interconnect Hydrogen Bonding and DNA Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is found in every living organism and contains the genetic information that determines the organism’s characteristics, provides the blueprint for making the proteins necessary for life, and serves as a template to pass this information on to the organism’s offspring. A DNA molecule consists of two (anti-)parallel chains of repeating nucleotides, which form its well-known double helical structure, as shown in Figure 10.13. Figure 10.13 Two separate DNA molecules form a double-stranded helix in which the molecules are held together via hydrogen bonding. (credit: modification of work by Jerome Walker, Dennis Myts) Each nucleotide contains a (deoxyribose) sugar bound to a phosphate group on one side, and one of four nitrogenous bases on the other. Two of the bases, cytosine (C) and thymine (T), are single-ringed structures known as pyrimidines. The other two, adenine (A) and guanine (G), are double-ringed structures called purines. These bases form complementary base pairs consisting of one purine and one pyrimidine, with adenine pairing with thymine, and cytosine with guanine. Each base pair is held together by hydrogen bonding. A and T share two hydrogen bonds, C and G share three, and both pairings have a similar shape and structure Figure 10.14. https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

Chapter 10 | Liquids and Solids 539 Figure 10.14 The geometries of the base molecules result in maximum hydrogen bonding between adenine and thymine (AT) and between guanine and cytosine (GC), so-called “complementary base pairs.” The cumulative effect of millions of hydrogen bonds effectively holds the two strands of DNA together. Importantly, the two strands of DNA can relatively easily “unzip” down the middle since hydrogen bonds are relatively weak compared to the covalent bonds that hold the atoms of the individual DNA molecules together. This allows both strands to function as a template for replication. 10.2 Properties of Liquids By the end of this section, you will be able to: Distinguish between adhesive and cohesive forces • Define viscosity, surface tension, and capillary rise • Describe the roles of intermolecular attractive forces in each of these properties/phenomena • When you pour a glass of water, or fill a car with gasoline, you observe that water and gasoline flow freely. But when you pour syrup on pancakes or add oil to a car engine, you note that syrup and motor oil do not flow as readily. The viscosity of a liquid is a measure of its resistance to flow. Water, gasoline, and other liquids that flow freely have a Figure 10.15, low viscosity. Honey, syrup, motor oil, and other liquids that do not flow freely, like those shown in have higher viscosities. We can measure viscosity by measuring the rate at which a metal ball falls through a liquid (the ball falls more slowly through a more viscous liquid) or by measuring the rate at which a liquid flows through a narrow tube (more viscous liquids flow more slowly).

(credit a: modification of work by Scott Bauer; credit b: modification of work by David Nagy) The IMFs between the molecules of a liquid, the size and shape of the molecules, and the temperature determine Table 10.2 how easily a liquid flows. As shows, the more structurally complex are the molecules in a liquid and the stronger the IMFs between them, the more difficult it is for them to move past each other and the greater is the viscosity of the liquid. As the temperature increases, the molecules move more rapidly and their kinetic energies are better able to overcome the forces that hold them together; thus, the viscosity of the liquid decreases. Viscosities of Common Substances at 25 °C Substance Formula Viscosity (mPa·s) water H2O 0.890 mercury Hg 1.526 ethanol C2H5OH 1.074 octane C8H18 0.508 ethylene glycol CH2(OH)CH2(OH) 16.1 honey variable ~2,000–10,000 motor oil variable ~50–500 Table 10.2 The various IMFs between identical molecules of a substance are examples of cohesive forces. The molecules within a liquid are surrounded by other molecules and are attracted equally in all directions by the cohesive forces within the liquid. However, the molecules on the surface of a liquid are attracted only by about one-half as many molecules. Because of the unbalanced molecular attractions on the surface molecules, liquids contract to form a shape that minimizes the number of molecules on the surface—that is, the shape with the minimum surface area. A small drop Figure 10.16, of liquid tends to assume a spherical shape, as shown in because in a sphere, the ratio of surface area https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

Figure 10.16 Attractive forces result in a spherical water drop that minimizes surface area; cohesive forces hold the sphere together; adhesive forces keep the drop attached to the web. (credit photo: modification of work by “OliBac”/Flickr) Surface tension is defined as the energy required to increase the surface area of a liquid, or the force required to increase the length of a liquid surface by a given amount. This property results from the cohesive forces between molecules at the surface of a liquid, and it causes the surface of a liquid to behave like a stretched rubber membrane. Table 10.3. Surface tensions of several liquids are presented in Among common liquids, water exhibits a distinctly high surface tension due to strong hydrogen bonding between its molecules. As a result of this high surface tension, the surface of water represents a relatively “tough skin” that can withstand considerable force without breaking. A Figure 10.17, steel needle carefully placed on water will float. Some insects, like the one shown in even though they are denser than water, move on its surface because they are supported by the surface tension.

542 Chapter 10 | Liquids and Solids Figure 10.17 Surface tension (right) prevents this insect, a “water strider,” from sinking into the water. The IMFs of attraction between two different molecules are called adhesive forces. Consider what happens when water comes into contact with some surface. If the adhesive forces between water molecules and the molecules of the surface are weak compared to the cohesive forces between the water molecules, the water does not “wet” the surface. For example, water does not wet waxed surfaces or many plastics such as polyethylene. Water forms drops on these surfaces because the cohesive forces within the drops are greater than the adhesive forces between the water and the plastic. Water spreads out on glass because the adhesive force between water and glass is greater than the cohesive forces within the water. When water is confined in a glass tube, its meniscus (surface) has a concave shape because the water wets the glass and creeps up the side of the tube. On the other hand, the cohesive forces between mercury atoms are much greater than the adhesive forces between mercury and glass. Mercury therefore does not wet glass, and it forms a convex meniscus when confined in a tube because the cohesive forces within the mercury tend to draw (Figure 10.18). it into a drop Figure 10.18 Differences in the relative strengths of cohesive and adhesive forces result in different meniscus shapes for mercury (left) and water (right) in glass tubes.

A similar process occurs in a cloth towel when you use it to dry off after a shower. These are examples of capillary action—when a liquid flows within a porous material due to the attraction of the liquid molecules to the surface of the material and to other liquid molecules. The adhesive forces between the liquid and the porous material, combined with the cohesive forces within the liquid, may be strong enough to move the liquid upward against gravity. https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

Chapter 10 | Liquids and Solids 543 Figure 10.19 Wine wicks up a paper towel (left) because of the strong attractions of water (and ethanol) molecules to the −OH groups on the towel’s cellulose fibers and the strong attractions of water molecules to other water (and ethanol) molecules (right). (credit photo: modification of work by Mark Blaser) Towels soak up liquids like water because the fibers of a towel are made of molecules that are attracted to water molecules. Most cloth towels are made of cotton, and paper towels are generally made from paper pulp. Both consist of long molecules of cellulose that contain many −OH groups. Water molecules are attracted to these −OH groups and form hydrogen bonds with them, which draws the H2O molecules up the cellulose molecules. The water molecules are also attracted to each other, so large amounts of water are drawn up the cellulose fibers. Figure Capillary action can also occur when one end of a small diameter tube is immersed in a liquid, as illustrated in 10.20. If the liquid molecules are strongly attracted to the tube molecules, the liquid creeps up the inside of the tube until the weight of the liquid and the adhesive forces are in balance. The smaller the diameter of the tube is, the higher the liquid climbs. It is partly by capillary action occurring in plant cells called xylem that water and dissolved nutrients are brought from the soil up through the roots and into a plant. Capillary action is the basis for thin layer chromatography, a laboratory technique commonly used to separate small quantities of mixtures. You depend on a constant supply of tears to keep your eyes lubricated and on capillary action to pump tear fluid away.

544 Chapter 10 | Liquids and Solids Figure 10.20 Depending upon the relative strengths of adhesive and cohesive forces, a liquid may rise (such as water) or fall (such as mercury) in a glass capillary tube. The extent of the rise (or fall) is directly proportional to the surface tension of the liquid and inversely proportional to the density of the liquid and the radius of the tube. The height to which a liquid will rise in a capillary tube is determined by several factors as shown in the following equation: 2T cos θ h = rρg In this equation, h is the height of the liquid inside the capillary tube relative to the surface of the liquid outside the tube, T is the surface tension of the liquid, θ is the contact angle between the liquid and the tube, r is the radius of m/s2. the tube, ρ is the density of the liquid, and g is the acceleration due to gravity, 9.8 When the tube is made of a material to which the liquid molecules are strongly attracted, they will spread out completely on the surface, which corresponds to a contact angle of 0°. This is the situation for water rising in a glass tube. Example 10.4 Capillary Rise At 25 °C, how high will water rise in a glass capillary tube with an inner diameter of 0.25 mm? g/cm3. For water, T = 71.99 mN/m and ρ = 1.0 Solution 2T cos θ h = The liquid will rise to a height h given by: rρg m/s2, kg/s2.

Chapter 10 | Liquids and Solids 545 Water rises in a glass capillary tube to a height of 8.4 cm. What is the diameter of the capillary tube? Answer: diameter = 0.36 mm Chemistry in Everyday Life Biomedical Applications of Capillary Action Many medical tests require drawing a small amount of blood, for example to determine the amount of glucose in someone with diabetes or the hematocrit level in an athlete. This procedure can be easily done because of capillary action, the ability of a liquid to flow up a small tube against gravity, as shown in Figure 10.21. When your finger is pricked, a drop of blood forms and holds together due to surface tension—the unbalanced intermolecular attractions at the surface of the drop. Then, when the open end of a narrow-diameter glass tube touches the drop of blood, the adhesive forces between the molecules in the blood and those at the glass surface draw the blood up the tube. How far the blood goes up the tube depends on the diameter of the tube (and the type of fluid). A small tube has a relatively large surface area for a given volume of blood, which results in larger (relative) attractive forces, allowing the blood to be drawn farther up the tube. The liquid itself is held together by its own cohesive forces. When the weight of the liquid in the tube generates a downward force equal to the upward force associated with capillary action, the liquid stops rising. Figure 10.21 Blood is collected for medical analysis by capillary action, which draws blood into a small diameter glass tube.

As one example of global significance, consider the evaporation, condensation, freezing, and melting of water. These changes of state are essential aspects of our earth’s water cycle as well as many other natural phenomena and technological processes of central importance to our lives. In this module, the essential aspects of phase transitions are explored. Vaporization and Condensation When a liquid vaporizes in a closed container, gas molecules cannot escape. As these gas phase molecules move randomly about, they will occasionally collide with the surface of the condensed phase, and in some cases, these 

--- Page 554 ---
546 Chapter 10 | Liquids and Solids collisions will result in the molecules re-entering the condensed phase. The change from the gas phase to the liquid is called condensation. When the rate of condensation becomes equal to the rate of vaporization, neither the amount of the liquid nor the amount of the vapor in the container changes. The vapor in the container is then said to be in equilibrium with the liquid. Keep in mind that this is not a static situation, as molecules are continually exchanged between the condensed and gaseous phases. Such is an example of a dynamic equilibrium, the status of a system in which reciprocal processes (for example, vaporization and condensation) occur at equal rates. The pressure exerted by the vapor in equilibrium with a liquid in a closed container at a given temperature is called the liquid’s vapor pressure (or equilibrium vapor pressure). The area of the surface of the liquid in contact with a vapor and the size of the vessel have no effect on the vapor pressure, although they do affect the time required for the equilibrium to be reached. We can measure the vapor pressure of a liquid by placing a sample in a closed container, like that illustrated Figure 10.22, in and using a manometer to measure the increase in pressure that is due to the vapor in equilibrium with the condensed phase. Figure 10.22 In a closed container, dynamic equilibrium is reached when (a) the rate of molecules escaping from the liquid to become the gas (b) increases and eventually (c) equals the rate of gas molecules entering the liquid. When this equilibrium is reached, the vapor pressure of the gas is constant, although the vaporization and condensation processes continue. The chemical identities of the molecules in a liquid determine the types (and strengths) of intermolecular attractions possible; consequently, different substances will exhibit different equilibrium vapor pressures. Relatively strong intermolecular attractive forces will serve to impede vaporization as well as favoring “recapture” of gas-phase molecules when they collide with the liquid surface, resulting in a relatively low vapor pressure. Weak intermolecular attractions present less of a barrier to vaporization, and a reduced likelihood of gas recapture, yielding relatively high vapor pressures. The following example illustrates this dependence of vapor pressure on intermolecular attractive forces.

Chapter 10 | Liquids and Solids 547 Diethyl ether has a very small dipole and most of its intermolecular attractions are London forces. Although this molecule is the largest of the four under consideration, its IMFs are the weakest and, as a result, its molecules most readily escape from the liquid. It also has the highest vapor pressure. Due to its smaller size, ethanol exhibits weaker dispersion forces than diethyl ether. However, ethanol is capable of hydrogen bonding and, therefore, exhibits stronger overall IMFs, which means that fewer molecules escape from the liquid at any given temperature, and so ethanol has a lower vapor pressure than diethyl ether. Water is much smaller than either of the previous substances and exhibits weaker dispersion forces, but its extensive hydrogen bonding provides stronger intermolecular attractions, fewer molecules escaping the liquid, and a lower vapor pressure than for either diethyl ether or ethanol. Ethylene glycol has two −OH groups, so, like water, it exhibits extensive hydrogen bonding. It is much larger than water and thus experiences larger London forces. Its overall IMFs are the largest of these four substances, which means its vaporization rate will be the slowest and, consequently, its vapor pressure the lowest. Check Your Learning At 20 °C, the vapor pressures of several alcohols are given in this table. Explain these vapor pressures in terms of types and extents of IMFs for these alcohols: Compound methanol ethanol propanol butanol CH3OH C2H5OH C3H7OH C4H9OH Vapor Pressure at 25 11.9 kPa 5.95 kPa 2.67 kPa 0.56 kPa °C Answer: All these compounds exhibit hydrogen bonding; these strong IMFs are difficult for the molecules to overcome, so the vapor pressures are relatively low. As the size of molecule increases from methanol to butanol, dispersion forces increase, which means that the vapor pressures decrease as observed: Pmethanol > Pethanol > Ppropanol > Pbutanol. As temperature increases, the vapor pressure of a liquid also increases due to the increased average KE of its molecules. Recall that at any given temperature, the molecules of a substance experience a range of kinetic energies, with a certain fraction of molecules having a sufficient energy to overcome IMF and escape the liquid (vaporize). At a higher temperature, a greater fraction of molecules have enough energy to escape from the liquid, as shown in Figure 10.23. The escape of more molecules per unit of time and the greater average speed of the molecules that escape both contribute to the higher vapor pressure.

548 Chapter 10 | Liquids and Solids Figure 10.23 Temperature affects the distribution of kinetic energies for the molecules in a liquid. At the higher temperature, more molecules have the necessary kinetic energy, KE, to escape from the liquid into the gas phase. Boiling Points When the vapor pressure increases enough to equal the external atmospheric pressure, the liquid reaches its boiling point. The boiling point of a liquid is the temperature at which its equilibrium vapor pressure is equal to the pressure exerted on the liquid by its gaseous surroundings. For liquids in open containers, this pressure is that due to the earth’s atmosphere. The normal boiling point of a liquid is defined as its boiling point when surrounding pressure is equal Figure 10.24 to 1 atm (101.3 kPa). shows the variation in vapor pressure with temperature for several different substances. Considering the definition of boiling point, these curves may be seen as depicting the dependence of a liquid’s boiling point on surrounding pressure.

Solution Figure 10.24 The graph of the vapor pressure of water versus temperature in indicates that the vapor pressure of water is 68 kPa at about 90 °C.

Answer: Approximately 40 kPa (0.4 atm) The quantitative relation between a substance’s vapor pressure and its temperature is described by the Clausius- Clapeyron equation: −ΔHvap /RT P = Ae where ΔHvap is the enthalpy of vaporization for the liquid, R is the gas constant, and ln A is a constant whose value depends on the chemical identity of the substance. This equation is often rearranged into logarithmic form to yield the linear equation: −ΔHvap ln P = + ln A RT This linear equation may be expressed in a two-point format that is convenient for use in various computations, as demonstrated in the example exercises that follow. If at temperature T1, the vapor pressure is P1, and at temperature T2, the vapor pressure is T2, the corresponding linear equations are: −ΔHvap −ΔHvap ln P1 = + ln A and ln P2 = + ln A RT1 RT2 Since the constant, ln A, is the same, these two equations may be rearranged to isolate ln A and then set them equal to one another: ΔHvap ΔHvap ln P1 + = ln P2 + RT1 RT2 which can be combined into: ⎞ ⎛ ⎞ ⎛ ΔHvap P2 −1 1 ⎠= ⎝ ⎠ ⎝ ln R T1 T2 P1 Example 10.7 Estimating Enthalpy of Vaporization Isooctane (2,2,4-trimethylpentane) has an octane rating of 100. It is used as one of the standards for the octane-rating system for gasoline. At 34.0 °C, the vapor pressure of isooctane is 10.0 kPa, and at 98.8 °C, its vapor pressure is 100.0 kPa. Use this information to estimate the enthalpy of vaporization for isooctane. Solution The enthalpy of vaporization, ΔHvap, can be determined by using the Clausius-Clapeyron equation:

What is the boiling point of benzene in Denver, where atmospheric pressure = 83.4 kPa? Solution If the temperature and vapor pressure are known at one point, along with the enthalpy of vaporization, ΔHvap, then the temperature that corresponds to a different vapor pressure (or the vapor pressure that corresponds to a different temperature) can be determined by using the Clausius-Clapeyron equation: ⎞ ⎛ ⎞ ⎛ ΔHvap P2 −1 1 ⎠= ⎝ ⎠ ⎝ ln T2 R T1 P1 Since the normal boiling point is the temperature at which the vapor pressure equals atmospheric pressure at sea level, we know one vapor pressure-temperature value (T1 = 80.1 °C = 353.3 K, P1 = 101.3 kPa, ΔHvap = 30.8 kJ/mol) and want to find the temperature (T2) that corresponds to vapor pressure P2 = 83.4 kPa.

Chapter 10 | Liquids and Solids 551 Enthalpy of Vaporization Vaporization is an endothermic process. The cooling effect can be evident when you leave a swimming pool or a shower. When the water on your skin evaporates, it removes heat from your skin and causes you to feel cold. The energy change associated with the vaporization process is the enthalpy of vaporization, ΔHvap. For example, the vaporization of water at standard temperature is represented by: H2 O(l) ⟶H2 O(g) ΔHvap = 44.01 kJ/mol As described in the chapter on thermochemistry, the reverse of an endothermic process is exothermic. And so, the condensation of a gas releases heat: −ΔHvap = −44.01 kJ/mol H2 O(g) ⟶H2 O(l) ΔHcon = Example 10.9 Using Enthalpy of Vaporization (Figure 10.25). One way our body is cooled is by evaporation of the water in sweat In very hot climates, we can lose as much as 1.5 L of sweat per day. Although sweat is not pure water, we can get an approximate value of the amount of heat removed by evaporation by assuming that it is. How much heat is required to evaporate 1.5 L of water (1.5 kg) at T = 37 °C (normal body temperature); ΔHvap = 43.46 kJ/mol at 37 °C. Figure 10.25 Evaporation of sweat helps cool the body.

552 Chapter 10 | Liquids and Solids Melting and Freezing When we heat a crystalline solid, we increase the average energy of its atoms, molecules, or ions and the solid gets hotter. At some point, the added energy becomes large enough to partially overcome the forces holding the molecules or ions of the solid in their fixed positions, and the solid begins the process of transitioning to the liquid state, or melting. At this point, the temperature of the solid stops rising, despite the continual input of heat, and it remains constant until all of the solid is melted. Only after all of the solid has melted will continued heating increase the (Figure 10.26). temperature of the liquid Figure 10.26 (a) This beaker of ice has a temperature of −12.0 °C. (b) After 10 minutes the ice has absorbed enough heat from the air to warm to 0 °C. A small amount has melted. (c) Thirty minutes later, the ice has absorbed more heat, but its temperature is still 0 °C. The ice melts without changing its temperature. (d) Only after all the ice has melted does the heat absorbed cause the temperature to increase to 22.2 °C. (credit: modification of work by Mark Ott) If we stop heating during melting and place the mixture of solid and liquid in a perfectly insulated container so no heat can enter or escape, the solid and liquid phases remain in equilibrium. This is almost the situation with a mixture of ice and water in a very good thermos bottle; almost no heat gets in or out, and the mixture of solid ice and liquid water remains for hours. In a mixture of solid and liquid at equilibrium, the reciprocal process of melting and freezing occur at equal rates, and the quantities of solid and liquid therefore remain constant. The temperature at which the solid and liquid phases of a given substance are in equilibrium is called the melting point of the solid or the freezing point of the liquid. Use of one term or the other is normally dictated by the direction of the phase transition being considered, for example, solid to liquid (melting) or liquid to solid (freezing). The enthalpy of fusion and the melting point of a crystalline solid depend on the strength of the attractive forces between the units present in the crystal. Molecules with weak attractive forces form crystals with low melting points. Crystals consisting of particles with stronger attractive forces melt at higher temperatures. The amount of heat required to change one mole of a substance from the solid state to the liquid state is the enthalpy of fusion, ΔHfus of the substance. The enthalpy of fusion of ice is 6.0 kJ/mol at 0 °C. Fusion (melting) is an endothermic process: O(l) ΔHfus = H2 O(s) ⟶H2 6.01 kJ/mol The reciprocal process, freezing, is an exothermic process whose enthalpy change is −6.0 kJ/mol at 0 °C: H2 O(l) ΔHfrz −ΔHfus = −6.01 kJ/mol ⟶H2 O(s) = Sublimation and Deposition Some solids can transition directly into the gaseous state, bypassing the liquid state, via a process known as sublimation. At room temperature and standard pressure, a piece of dry ice (solid CO2) sublimes, appearing to gradually disappear without ever forming any liquid. Snow and ice sublime at temperatures below the melting point of water, a slow process that may be accelerated by winds and the reduced atmospheric pressures at high altitudes. When (Figure 10.27). solid iodine is warmed, the solid sublimes and a vivid purple vapor forms The reverse of sublimation https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at 

--- Page 561 ---
Chapter 10 | Liquids and Solids 553 is called deposition, a process in which gaseous substances condense directly into the solid state, bypassing the liquid state. The formation of frost is an example of deposition. Figure 10.27 Sublimation of solid iodine in the bottom of the tube produces a purple gas that subsequently deposits as solid iodine on the colder part of the tube above. (credit: modification of work by Mark Ott) Like vaporization, the process of sublimation requires an input of energy to overcome intermolecular attractions. The enthalpy of sublimation, ΔHsub, is the energy required to convert one mole of a substance from the solid to the gaseous state. For example, the sublimation of carbon dioxide is represented by: CO2(s) ⟶CO2(g) ΔHsub = 26.1 kJ/mol Likewise, the enthalpy change for the reverse process of deposition is equal in magnitude but opposite in sign to that for sublimation: CO2(g) ⟶CO2(s) ΔHdep = −ΔHsub = −26.1 kJ/mol Consider the extent to which intermolecular attractions must be overcome to achieve a given phase transition. Converting a solid into a liquid requires that these attractions be only partially overcome; transition to the gaseous state requires that they be completely overcome. As a result, the enthalpy of fusion for a substance is less than its enthalpy of vaporization. This same logic can be used to derive an approximate relation between the enthalpies of all phase changes for a given substance. Though not an entirely accurate description, sublimation may be conveniently

554 Chapter 10 | Liquids and Solids modeled as a sequential two-step process of melting followed by vaporization in order to apply Hess’s Law. Viewed in this manner, the enthalpy of sublimation for a substance may be estimated as the sum of its enthalpies of fusion and Figure 10.28. vaporization, as illustrated in For example: solid ⟶liquid ΔHfus liquid ⟶gas ΔHvap solid ⟶gas ΔHsub = ΔHfus + ΔHvap Figure 10.28 For a given substance, the sum of its enthalpy of fusion and enthalpy of vaporization is approximately equal to its enthalpy of sublimation. Heating and Cooling Curves In the chapter on thermochemistry, the relation between the amount of heat absorbed or related by a substance, q, and its accompanying temperature change, ΔT, was introduced: q = mcΔT where m is the mass of the substance and c is its specific heat. The relation applies to matter being heated or cooled, but not undergoing a change in state. When a substance being heated or cooled reaches a temperature corresponding to one of its phase transitions, further gain or loss of heat is a result of diminishing or enhancing intermolecular attractions, instead of increasing or decreasing molecular kinetic energies. While a substance is undergoing a change Figure 10.29 in state, its temperature remains constant. shows a typical heating curve. Consider the example of heating a pot of water to boiling. A stove burner will supply heat at a roughly constant rate; initially, this heat serves to increase the water’s temperature. When the water reaches its boiling point, the temperature remains constant despite the continued input of heat from the stove burner. This same temperature is maintained by the water as long as it is boiling. If the burner setting is increased to provide heat at a greater rate, the water temperature does not rise, but instead the boiling becomes more vigorous (rapid). This behavior is observed for other phase transitions as well: For example, temperature remains constant while the change of state is in progress. https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

Answer: 40.5 kJ 10.4 Phase Diagrams By the end of this section, you will be able to: Explain the construction and use of a typical phase diagram • Use phase diagrams to identify stable phases at given temperatures and pressures, and to describe • phase transitions resulting from changes in these properties Describe the supercritical fluid phase of matter • In the previous module, the variation of a liquid’s equilibrium vapor pressure with temperature was described. Considering the definition of boiling point, plots of vapor pressure versus temperature represent how the boiling point of the liquid varies with pressure. Also described was the use of heating and cooling curves to determine a substance’s melting (or freezing) point. Making such measurements over a wide range of pressures yields data that may be presented graphically as a phase diagram. A phase diagram combines plots of pressure versus temperature for the liquid-gas, solid-liquid, and solid-gas phase-transition equilibria of a substance. These diagrams indicate the physical states that exist under specific conditions of pressure and temperature, and also provide the pressure dependence of the phase-transition temperatures (melting points, sublimation points, boiling points).

To illustrate the utility of these plots, consider the phase diagram for water shown in Figure 10.31 The pressure and temperature axes on this phase diagram of water are not drawn to constant scale in order to illustrate several important properties. We can use the phase diagram to identify the physical state of a sample of water under specified conditions of pressure and temperature. For example, a pressure of 50 kPa and a temperature of −10 °C correspond to the region of the diagram labeled “ice.” Under these conditions, water exists only as a solid (ice). A pressure of 50 kPa and a temperature of 50 °C correspond to the “water” region—here, water exists only as a liquid. At 25 kPa and 200 °C,

558 Chapter 10 | Liquids and Solids water exists only in the gaseous state. Note that on the H2O phase diagram, the pressure and temperature axes are not drawn to a constant scale in order to permit the illustration of several important features as described here. Figure 10.31 The curve BC in is the plot of vapor pressure versus temperature as described in the previous module of this chapter. This “liquid-vapor” curve separates the liquid and gaseous regions of the phase diagram and provides the boiling point for water at any pressure. For example, at 1 atm, the boiling point is 100 °C. Notice that the liquid- vapor curve terminates at a temperature of 374 °C and a pressure of 218 atm, indicating that water cannot exist as a liquid above this temperature, regardless of the pressure. The physical properties of water under these conditions are intermediate between those of its liquid and gaseous phases. This unique state of matter is called a supercritical fluid, a topic that will be described in the next section of this module. Figure 10.31, The solid-vapor curve, labeled AB in indicates the temperatures and pressures at which ice and water vapor are in equilibrium. These temperature-pressure data pairs correspond to the sublimation, or deposition, points Figure 10.31, for water. If we could zoom in on the solid-gas line in we would see that ice has a vapor pressure of about 0.20 kPa at −10 °C. Thus, if we place a frozen sample in a vacuum with a pressure less than 0.20 kPa, ice will sublime. This is the basis for the “freeze-drying” process often used to preserve foods, such as the ice cream shown Figure 10.32. in Figure 10.32 Freeze-dried foods, like this ice cream, are dehydrated by sublimation at pressures below the triple ʺlwaoʺ/Flickr) point for water.

Note that this curve exhibits a slight negative slope (greatly exaggerated for clarity), indicating that the melting point for water decreases slightly as pressure increases. Water is an unusual substance in this regard, as most substances exhibit an increase in melting point with increasing Figure 10.33. pressure. This behavior is partly responsible for the movement of glaciers, like the one shown in The bottom of a glacier experiences an immense pressure due to its weight that can melt some of the ice, forming a layer of liquid water on which the glacier may more easily slide. https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

The point of intersection of all three curves is labeled B in At the pressure and temperature represented by this point, all three phases of water coexist in equilibrium.

Notice that the triple point is well above 1 atm, indicating that carbon dioxide cannot exist as a liquid under ambient pressure conditions.

Chapter 10 | Liquids and Solids 561 Supercritical Fluids If we place a sample of water in a sealed container at 25 °C, remove the air, and let the vaporization-condensation equilibrium establish itself, we are left with a mixture of liquid water and water vapor at a pressure of 0.03 atm. A distinct boundary between the more dense liquid and the less dense gas is clearly observed. As we increase the temperature, the pressure of the water vapor increases, as described by the liquid-gas curve in the phase diagram for (Figure 10.31), water and a two-phase equilibrium of liquid and gaseous phases remains. At a temperature of 374 °C, the vapor pressure has risen to 218 atm, and any further increase in temperature results in the disappearance of the boundary between liquid and vapor phases. All of the water in the container is now present in a single phase whose physical properties are intermediate between those of the gaseous and liquid states. This phase of matter is called (Figure a supercritical fluid, and the temperature and pressure above which this phase exists is the critical point 10.35). Above its critical temperature, a gas cannot be liquefied no matter how much pressure is applied. The pressure required to liquefy a gas at its critical temperature is called the critical pressure. The critical temperatures and critical Table 10.3. pressures of some common substances are given in Substance Critical Temperature (K) Critical Pressure (atm) hydrogen 33.2 12.8 nitrogen 126.0 33.5 oxygen 154.3 49.7 carbon dioxide 304.2 73.0 ammonia 405.5 111.5 sulfur dioxide 430.3 77.7 water 647.1 217.7 Figure 10.35 (a) A sealed container of liquid carbon dioxide slightly below its critical point is heated, resulting in (b) the formation of the supercritical fluid phase.

562 Chapter 10 | Liquids and Solids Link to Learning Observe the liquid-to-supercritical fluid transition (http://openstaxcollege.org/ l/16supercrit) for carbon dioxide. Like a gas, a supercritical fluid will expand and fill a container, but its density is much greater than typical gas densities, typically being close to those for liquids. Similar to liquids, these fluids are capable of dissolving nonvolatile solutes. They exhibit essentially no surface tension and very low viscosities, however, so they can more effectively penetrate very small openings in a solid mixture and remove soluble components. These properties make supercritical fluids extremely useful solvents for a wide range of applications. For example, supercritical carbon dioxide has become a very popular solvent in the food industry, being used to decaffeinate coffee, remove fats from potato chips, and extract flavor and fragrance compounds from citrus oils. It is nontoxic, relatively inexpensive, and not considered to be a pollutant. After use, the CO2 can be easily recovered by reducing the pressure and collecting the resulting gas. Example 10.13 The Critical Temperature of Carbon Dioxide If we shake a carbon dioxide fire extinguisher on a cool day (18 °C), we can hear liquid CO2 sloshing around inside the cylinder. However, the same cylinder appears to contain no liquid on a hot summer day (35 °C). Explain these observations. Solution (Table On the cool day, the temperature of the CO2 is below the critical temperature of CO2, 304 K or 31 °C 10.3), so liquid CO2 is present in the cylinder. On the hot day, the temperature of the CO2 is greater than its critical temperature of 31 °C. Above this temperature no amount of pressure can liquefy CO2 so no liquid CO2 exists in the fire extinguisher. Check Your Learning Ammonia can be liquefied by compression at room temperature; oxygen cannot be liquefied under these conditions. Why do the two gases exhibit different behavior? Answer: The critical temperature of ammonia is 405.5 K, which is higher than room temperature. The critical temperature of oxygen is below room temperature; thus oxygen cannot be liquefied at room temperature. Chemistry in Everyday Life Decaffeinating Coffee Using Supercritical CO2 Coffee is the world’s second most widely traded commodity, following only petroleum. Across the globe, people love coffee’s aroma and taste. Many of us also depend on one component of coffee—caffeine—to help us get going in the morning or stay alert in the afternoon. But late in the day, coffee’s stimulant effect can keep you from sleeping, so you may choose to drink decaffeinated coffee in the evening. Since the early 1900s, many methods have been used to decaffeinate coffee. All have advantages and disadvantages, and all depend on the physical and chemical properties of caffeine. Because caffeine is https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

Chapter 10 | Liquids and Solids 563 a somewhat polar molecule, it dissolves well in water, a polar liquid. However, since many of the other 400-plus compounds that contribute to coffee’s taste and aroma also dissolve in H2O, hot water decaffeination processes can also remove some of these compounds, adversely affecting the smell and taste of the decaffeinated coffee. Dichloromethane (CH2Cl2) and ethyl acetate (CH3CO2C2H5) have similar polarity to caffeine, and are therefore very effective solvents for caffeine extraction, but both also remove some flavor and aroma components, and their use requires long extraction and cleanup times. Because both of these solvents are toxic, health concerns have been raised regarding the effect of residual solvent remaining in the decaffeinated coffee. Supercritical fluid extraction using carbon dioxide is now being widely used as a more effective and environmentally friendly decaffeination method (Figure 10.36). At temperatures above 304.2 K and pressures above 7376 kPa, CO2 is a supercritical fluid, with properties of both gas and liquid. Like a gas, it penetrates deep into the coffee beans; like a liquid, it effectively dissolves certain substances. Supercritical carbon dioxide extraction of steamed coffee beans removes 97−99% of the caffeine, leaving coffee’s flavor and aroma compounds intact. Because CO2 is a gas under standard conditions, its removal from the extracted coffee beans is easily accomplished, as is the recovery of the caffeine from the extract. The caffeine recovered from coffee beans via this process is a valuable product that can be used subsequently as an additive to other foods or drugs. Figure 10.36 (a) Caffeine molecules have both polar and nonpolar regions, making it soluble in solvents of varying polarities. (b) The schematic shows a typical decaffeination process involving supercritical carbon dioxide.

The particles of such solids lack an ordered internal structure and are randomly arranged (Figure 10.37). Figure 10.37 The entities of a solid phase may be arranged in a regular, repeating pattern (crystalline solids) or randomly (amorphous). Metals and ionic compounds typically form ordered, crystalline solids. Substances that consist of large molecules, or a mixture of molecules whose movements are more restricted, often form amorphous solids. For examples, candle waxes are amorphous solids composed of large hydrocarbon molecules. Some substances, such as boron oxide Figure 10.38), (shown in can form either crystalline or amorphous solids, depending on the conditions under which it is produced. Also, amorphous solids may undergo a transition to the crystalline state under appropriate conditions. https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

Chapter 10 | Liquids and Solids 565 Figure 10.38 (a) Diboron trioxide, B2O3, is normally found as a white, amorphous solid (a glass), which has a high degree of disorder in its structure. (b) By careful, extended heating, it can be converted into a crystalline form of B2O3, which has a very ordered arrangement. Crystalline solids are generally classified according the nature of the forces that hold its particles together. These forces are primarily responsible for the physical properties exhibited by the bulk solids. The following sections provide descriptions of the major types of crystalline solids: ionic, metallic, covalent network, and molecular. Ionic Solids Ionic solids, such as sodium chloride and nickel oxide, are composed of positive and negative ions that are held (Figure 10.39). together by electrostatic attractions, which can be quite strong Many ionic crystals also have high melting points. This is due to the very strong attractions between the ions—in ionic compounds, the attractions between full charges are (much) larger than those between the partial charges in polar molecular compounds. This will be looked at in more detail in a later discussion of lattice energies. Although they are hard, they also tend to be brittle, and they shatter rather than bend. Ionic solids do not conduct electricity; however, they do conduct when molten or dissolved because their ions are free to move. Many simple compounds formed by the reaction of a metallic element with a nonmetallic element are ionic. Figure 10.39 Sodium chloride is an ionic solid. Metallic Solids Figure 10.40. Metallic solids such as crystals of copper, aluminum, and iron are formed by metal atoms The structure of metallic crystals is often described as a uniform distribution of atomic nuclei within a “sea” of delocalized electrons. The atoms within such a metallic solid are held together by a unique force known as metallic bonding that gives rise to many useful and varied bulk properties. All exhibit high thermal and electrical conductivity, metallic

566 Chapter 10 | Liquids and Solids luster, and malleability. Many are very hard and quite strong. Because of their malleability (the ability to deform under pressure or hammering), they do not shatter and, therefore, make useful construction materials. The melting points of the metals vary widely. Mercury is a liquid at room temperature, and the alkali metals melt below 200 °C. Several post-transition metals also have low melting points, whereas the transition metals melt at temperatures above 1000 °C. These differences reflect differences in strengths of metallic bonding among the metals. Figure 10.40 Copper is a metallic solid. Covalent Network Solid Covalent network solids include crystals of diamond, silicon, some other nonmetals, and some covalent compounds such as silicon dioxide (sand) and silicon carbide (carborundum, the abrasive on sandpaper). Many minerals have networks of covalent bonds. The atoms in these solids are held together by a network of covalent bonds, as shown in Figure 10.41. To break or to melt a covalent network solid, covalent bonds must be broken. Because covalent bonds are relatively strong, covalent network solids are typically characterized by hardness, strength, and high melting points. For example, diamond is one of the hardest substances known and melts above 3500 °C. Figure 10.41 A covalent crystal contains a three-dimensional network of covalent bonds, as illustrated by the structures of diamond, silicon dioxide, silicon carbide, and graphite. Graphite is an exceptional example, composed of planar sheets of covalent crystals that are held together in layers by noncovalent forces. Unlike typical covalent solids, graphite is very soft and electrically conductive. https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

Chapter 10 | Liquids and Solids 567 Molecular Solid Figure 10.42, Molecular solids, such as ice, sucrose (table sugar), and iodine, as shown in are composed of neutral molecules. The strengths of the attractive forces between the units present in different crystals vary widely, as indicated by the melting points of the crystals. Small symmetrical molecules (nonpolar molecules), such as H2, N2, O2, and F2, have weak attractive forces and form molecular solids with very low melting points (below −200 °C). Substances consisting of larger, nonpolar molecules have larger attractive forces and melt at higher temperatures. Molecular solids composed of molecules with permanent dipole moments (polar molecules) melt at still higher temperatures. Examples include ice (melting point, 0 °C) and table sugar (melting point, 185 °C). Figure 10.42 Carbon dioxide (CO2) consists of small, nonpolar molecules and forms a molecular solid with a melting point of −78 °C. Iodine (I2) consists of larger, nonpolar molecules and forms a molecular solid that melts at 114 °C. Properties of Solids Table 10.4, A crystalline solid, like those listed in has a precise melting temperature because each atom or molecule of the same type is held in place with the same forces or energy. Thus, the attractions between the units that make up the crystal all have the same strength and all require the same amount of energy to be broken. The gradual softening of an amorphous material differs dramatically from the distinct melting of a crystalline solid. This results from the structural nonequivalence of the molecules in the amorphous solid. Some forces are weaker than others, and when an amorphous material is heated, the weakest intermolecular attractions break first. As the temperature is increased further, the stronger attractions are broken. Thus amorphous materials soften over a range of temperatures.

The unique properties of carbon atoms allow the existence of carbon-based life forms such as ourselves. Carbon forms a huge variety of substances that we use on a daily basis, including those shown in Figure 10.43. You may be familiar with diamond and graphite, the two most common allotropes of carbon. (Allotropes are different structural forms of the same element.) Diamond is one of the hardest-known substances, whereas graphite is soft enough to be used as pencil lead. These very different properties stem from the different arrangements of the carbon atoms in the different allotropes. Figure 10.43 Diamond is extremely hard because of the strong bonding between carbon atoms in all directions. Graphite (in pencil lead) rubs off onto paper due to the weak attractions between the carbon layers. An image of a graphite surface shows the distance between the centers of adjacent carbon atoms.

Graphene was first isolated in 2004 by using tape to peel off thinner and thinner layers from graphite.

These properties may prove very useful in a wide range of applications, such as vastly improved computer chips and circuits, better batteries and solar cells, and stronger and lighter structural materials. The 2010 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to Andre Geim and Konstantin Novoselov for their pioneering work with graphene. Figure 10.44 Graphene sheets can be formed into buckyballs, nanotubes, and stacked layers. Crystal Defects In a crystalline solid, the atoms, ions, or molecules are arranged in a definite repeating pattern, but occasional Figure 10.45. defects may occur in the pattern. Several types of defects are known, as illustrated in Vacancies are defects that occur when positions that should contain atoms or ions are vacant. Less commonly, some atoms or ions in a crystal may occupy positions, called interstitial sites, located between the regular positions for atoms. Other distortions are found in impure crystals, as, for example, when the cations, anions, or molecules of the impurity are too large to fit into the regular positions without distorting the structure. Trace amounts of impurities are sometimes added to a crystal (a process known as doping) in order to create defects in the structure that yield desirable changes in its properties. For example, silicon crystals are doped with varying amounts of different elements to yield suitable electrical properties for their use in the manufacture of semiconductors and computer chips.

570 Chapter 10 | Liquids and Solids Figure 10.45 Types of crystal defects include vacancies, interstitial atoms, and substitutions impurities. 10.6 Lattice Structures in Crystalline Solids By the end of this section, you will be able to: Describe the arrangement of atoms and ions in crystalline structures • Compute ionic radii using unit cell dimensions • Explain the use of X-ray diffraction measurements in determining crystalline structures • Over 90% of naturally occurring and man-made solids are crystalline. Most solids form with a regular arrangement of their particles because the overall attractive interactions between particles are maximized, and the total intermolecular energy is minimized, when the particles pack in the most efficient manner. The regular arrangement at an atomic level is often reflected at a macroscopic level. In this module, we will explore some of the details about the structures of metallic and ionic crystalline solids, and learn how these structures are determined experimentally. The Structures of Metals We will begin our discussion of crystalline solids by considering elemental metals, which are relatively simple because each contains only one type of atom. A pure metal is a crystalline solid with metal atoms packed closely together in a repeating pattern. Some of the properties of metals in general, such as their malleability and ductility, are largely due to having identical atoms arranged in a regular pattern. The different properties of one metal compared to another partially depend on the sizes of their atoms and the specifics of their spatial arrangements. We will explore the similarities and differences of four of the most common metal crystal geometries in the sections that follow. Unit Cells of Metals The structure of a crystalline solid, whether a metal or not, is best described by considering its simplest repeating unit, which is referred to as its unit cell. The unit cell consists of lattice points that represent the locations of atoms or ions. Figure 10.46. The entire structure then consists of this unit cell repeating in three dimensions, as illustrated in https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at 

--- Page 579 ---
Chapter 10 | Liquids and Solids 571 Figure 10.46 A unit cell shows the locations of lattice points repeating in all directions. Let us begin our investigation of crystal lattice structure and unit cells with the most straightforward structure and the most basic unit cell. To visualize this, imagine taking a large number of identical spheres, such as tennis balls, and arranging them uniformly in a container. The simplest way to do this would be to make layers in which the spheres Figure 10.47. in one layer are directly above those in the layer below, as illustrated in This arrangement is called simple cubic structure, and the unit cell is called the simple cubic unit cell or primitive cubic unit cell. Figure 10.47 When metal atoms are arranged with spheres in one layer directly above or below spheres in another layer, the lattice structure is called simple cubic. Note that the spheres are in contact. In a simple cubic structure, the spheres are not packed as closely as they could be, and they only “fill” about 52% of the volume of the container. This is a relatively inefficient arrangement, and only one metal (polonium, Po) Figure 10.48, crystallizes in a simple cubic structure. As shown in a solid with this type of arrangement consists of planes (or layers) in which each atom contacts only the four nearest neighbors in its layer; one atom directly above it in the layer above; and one atom directly below it in the layer below. The number of other particles that each particle in a crystalline solid contacts is known as its coordination number. For a polonium atom in a simple cubic array, the coordination number is, therefore, six. 

--- Page 580 ---
572 Chapter 10 | Liquids and Solids Figure 10.48 An atom in a simple cubic lattice structure contacts six other atoms, so it has a coordination number of six. In a simple cubic lattice, the unit cell that repeats in all directions is a cube defined by the centers of eight atoms, Figure 10.49. as shown in Atoms at adjacent corners of this unit cell contact each other, so the edge length of this cell is equal to two atomic radii, or one atomic diameter. A cubic unit cell contains only the parts of these atoms that are within it. Since an atom at a corner of a simple cubic unit cell is contained by a total of eight unit cells, only one-eighth of that atom is within a specific unit cell. And since each simple cubic unit cell has one atom at each of its 1 8 × = 1 atom within one simple cubic unit cell. eight “corners,” there is 8 Figure 10.49 A simple cubic lattice unit cell contains one-eighth of an atom at each of its eight corners, so it contains one atom total.

Chapter 10 | Liquids and Solids 573 (a) Two adjacent Po atoms contact each other, so the edge length of this cell is equal to two Po atomic radii: 336 pm l r = = = 168 pm. l = 2r. Therefore, the radius of Po is 2 2 mass density = volume. (b) Density is given by The density of polonium can be found by determining the density of its unit cell (the mass contained within a unit cell divided by the volume of the unit cell). Since a Po unit cell contains one-eighth of a Po atom at each of its eight corners, a unit cell contains one Po atom. The mass of a Po unit cell can be found by: 208.998 g 1 Po atom 1 mol Po 10−22 1 Po unit cell × × × = 3.47 × g 1 mol Po 1 Po unit cell 1023 6.022 × Po atoms The volume of a Po unit cell can be found by: 3 cm⎞ ⎛ 10−23 cm3 10−10 l3 = 3.79 × ⎝336 × V = = ⎠ (Note that the edge length was converted from pm to cm to get the usual volume units for density.) 10−22 3.471 × g g/cm3 Po = = 9.16 Therefore, the density of 10−23 cm3 3.79 × Check Your Learning g/cm3.

Answer: No. If Ni was simple cubic, its density would be given by: 58.693 g 1 mol Ni 10−23 1 Ni atom × × = 9.746 × g 1 mol Ni 1023 6.022 × Ni atoms 3 cm⎞ ⎛ 10−23 cm3 10−8 l3 = 4.376 × ⎝3.524 × V = = ⎠ 10−23 9.746 × g g/cm3 = = 2.23 Then the density of Ni would be 10−23 cm3 4.376 × Since the actual density of Ni is not close to this, Ni does not form a simple cubic structure. Most metal crystals are one of the four major types of unit cells. For now, we will focus on the three cubic unit cells: simple cubic (which we have already seen), body-centered cubic unit cell, and face-centered cubic unit cell—all Figure 10.50. of which are illustrated in (Note that there are actually seven different lattice systems, some of which have more than one type of lattice, for a total of 14 different types of unit cells. We leave the more complicated geometries for later in this module.)

574 Chapter 10 | Liquids and Solids Figure 10.50 Cubic unit cells of metals show (in the upper figures) the locations of lattice points and (in the lower figures) metal atoms located in the unit cell. Some metals crystallize in an arrangement that has a cubic unit cell with atoms at all of the corners and an atom in the Figure 10.51. center, as shown in This is called a body-centered cubic (BCC) solid. Atoms in the corners of a BCC unit cell do not contact each other but contact the atom in the center. A BCC unit cell contains two atoms: one-eighth 1 (8 × = 1 of an atom at each of the eight corners atom from the corners) plus one atom from the center. Any atom 8 in this structure touches four atoms in the layer above it and four atoms in the layer below it. Thus, an atom in a BCC structure has a coordination number of eight. Figure 10.51 In a body-centered cubic structure, atoms in a specific layer do not touch each other. Each atom touches four atoms in the layer above it and four atoms in the layer below it. https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at 

--- Page 583 ---
Chapter 10 | Liquids and Solids 575 Atoms in BCC arrangements are much more efficiently packed than in a simple cubic structure, occupying about 68% of the total volume. Isomorphous metals with a BCC structure include K, Ba, Cr, Mo, W, and Fe at room temperature. (Elements or compounds that crystallize with the same structure are said to be isomorphous.) Many other metals, such as aluminum, copper, and lead, crystallize in an arrangement that has a cubic unit cell with Figure 10.52. atoms at all of the corners and at the centers of each face, as illustrated in This arrangement is called a face-centered cubic (FCC) solid. A FCC unit cell contains four atoms: one-eighth of an atom at each of the eight 1 1 (8 × = 1 (6 × = 3 atom from the corners) and one-half of an atom on each of the six faces atoms from corners 8 2 the faces). The atoms at the corners touch the atoms in the centers of the adjacent faces along the face diagonals of the cube. Because the atoms are on identical lattice points, they have identical environments. Figure 10.52 A face-centered cubic solid has atoms at the corners and, as the name implies, at the centers of the faces of its unit cells. Atoms in an FCC arrangement are packed as closely together as possible, with atoms occupying 74% of the volume. This structure is also called cubic closest packing (CCP). In CCP, there are three repeating layers of hexagonally arranged atoms. Each atom contacts six atoms in its own layer, three in the layer above, and three in the layer below. In this arrangement, each atom touches 12 near neighbors, and therefore has a coordination number of 12. The fact that FCC and CCP arrangements are equivalent may not be immediately obvious, but why they are actually the same Figure 10.53. structure is illustrated in 

--- Page 584 ---
576 Chapter 10 | Liquids and Solids Figure 10.53 A CCP arrangement consists of three repeating layers (ABCABC…) of hexagonally arranged atoms. Atoms in a CCP structure have a coordination number of 12 because they contact six atoms in their layer, plus three atoms in the layer above and three atoms in the layer below. By rotating our perspective, we can see that a CCP structure has a unit cell with a face containing an atom from layer A at one corner, atoms from layer B across a diagonal (at two corners and in the middle of the face), and an atom from layer C at the remaining corner. This is the same as a face-centered cubic arrangement. Because closer packing maximizes the overall attractions between atoms and minimizes the total intermolecular energy, the atoms in most metals pack in this manner. We find two types of closest packing in simple metallic crystalline structures: CCP, which we have already encountered, and hexagonal closest packing (HCP) shown in Figure 10.54. Both consist of repeating layers of hexagonally arranged atoms. In both types, a second layer (B) is placed on the first layer (A) so that each atom in the second layer is in contact with three atoms in the first layer. The third layer is positioned in one of two ways. In HCP, atoms in the third layer are directly above atoms in the first layer (i.e., the third layer is also type A), and the stacking consists of alternating type A and type B close-packed ABABAB⋯). layers (i.e., In CCP, atoms in the third layer are not above atoms in either of the first two layers (i.e., the third layer is type C), and the stacking consists of alternating type A, type B, and type C close-packed layers (i.e., ABCABCABC⋯). About two–thirds of all metals crystallize in closest-packed arrays with coordination numbers of crystallize in an HCP structure include Cd, Co, Li, Mg, Na, and Zn, and metals that crystallize in a 12.

580 Chapter 10 | Liquids and Solids The Structures of Ionic Crystals Ionic crystals consist of two or more different kinds of ions that usually have different sizes. The packing of these ions into a crystal structure is more complex than the packing of metal atoms that are the same size. Most monatomic ions behave as charged spheres, and their attraction for ions of opposite charge is the same in every direction. Consequently, stable structures for ionic compounds result (1) when ions of one charge are surrounded by as many ions as possible of the opposite charge and (2) when the cations and anions are in contact with each other. Structures are determined by two principal factors: the relative sizes of the ions and the ratio of the numbers of positive and negative ions in the compound. In simple ionic structures, we usually find the anions, which are normally larger than the cations, arranged in a closest-packed array. (As seen previously, additional electrons attracted to the same nucleus make anions larger and fewer electrons attracted to the same nucleus make cations smaller when compared to the atoms from which they are formed.) The smaller cations commonly occupy one of two types of holes (or interstices) remaining between the anions. The smaller of the holes is found between three anions in one plane and one anion in an adjacent plane. The four anions surrounding this hole are arranged at the corners of a tetrahedron, so the hole is called a tetrahedral hole. The larger type of hole is found at the center of six anions (three in one layer and three in an adjacent layer) located at Figure 10.57 the corners of an octahedron; this is called an octahedral hole. illustrates both of these types of holes. Figure 10.57 Cations may occupy two types of holes between anions: octahedral holes or tetrahedral holes. Depending on the relative sizes of the cations and anions, the cations of an ionic compound may occupy tetrahedral or Figure 10.58. octahedral holes, as illustrated in Relatively small cations occupy tetrahedral holes, and larger cations occupy octahedral holes. If the cations are too large to fit into the octahedral holes, the anions may adopt a more open structure, such as a simple cubic array. The larger cations can then occupy the larger cubic holes made possible by the more open spacing. https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at 

--- Page 589 ---
Chapter 10 | Liquids and Solids 581 Figure 10.58 A cation’s size and the shape of the hole occupied by the compound are directly related. There are two tetrahedral holes for each anion in either an HCP or CCP array of anions. A compound that crystallizes in a closest-packed array of anions with cations in the tetrahedral holes can have a maximum cation:anion ratio of 2:1; all of the tetrahedral holes are filled at this ratio. Examples include Li2O, Na2O, Li2S, and Na2S. Compounds with a ratio of less than 2:1 may also crystallize in a closest-packed array of anions with cations in the tetrahedral holes, if the ionic sizes fit. In these compounds, however, some of the tetrahedral holes remain vacant. Example 10.16 Occupancy of Tetrahedral Holes Zinc sulfide is an important industrial source of zinc and is also used as a white pigment in paint. Zinc sulfide crystallizes with zinc ions occupying one-half of the tetrahedral holes in a closest-packed array of sulfide ions. What is the formula of zinc sulfide? Solution Because there are two tetrahedral holes per anion (sulfide ion) and one-half of these holes are occupied by 1 × 2, zinc ions, there must be or 1, zinc ion per sulfide ion. Thus, the formula is ZnS. 2 Check Your Learning Lithium selenide can be described as a closest-packed array of selenide ions with lithium ions in all of the tetrahedral holes. What it the formula of lithium selenide? Answer: Li2Se The ratio of octahedral holes to anions in either an HCP or CCP structure is 1:1. Thus, compounds with cations in octahedral holes in a closest-packed array of anions can have a maximum cation:anion ratio of 1:1. In NiO, MnS, NaCl, and KH, for example, all of the octahedral holes are filled. Ratios of less than 1:1 are observed when some of the octahedral holes remain empty. Example 10.17 Stoichiometry of Ionic Compounds Sapphire is aluminum oxide. Aluminum oxide crystallizes with aluminum ions in two-thirds of the octahedral holes in a closest-packed array of oxide ions. What is the formula of aluminum oxide? 

--- Page 590 ---

Check Your Learning The white pigment titanium oxide crystallizes with titanium ions in one-half of the octahedral holes in a closest-packed array of oxide ions. What is the formula of titanium oxide? Answer: TiO2 In a simple cubic array of anions, there is one cubic hole that can be occupied by a cation for each anion in the array. In CsCl, and in other compounds with the same structure, all of the cubic holes are occupied. Half of the cubic holes are occupied in SrH2, UO2, SrCl2, and CaF2. Different types of ionic compounds often crystallize in the same structure when the relative sizes of their ions and their stoichiometries (the two principal features that determine structure) are similar. Unit Cells of Ionic Compounds Many ionic compounds crystallize with cubic unit cells, and we will use these compounds to describe the general features of ionic structures. When an ionic compound is composed of cations and anions of similar size in a 1:1 ratio, it typically forms a simple Cs+ Cl−having Figure 10.59) cubic structure. Cesium chloride, CsCl, (illustrated in is an example of this, with and radii of 174 pm and 181 pm, respectively. We can think of this as chloride ions forming a simple cubic unit cell, with a cesium ion in the center; or as cesium ions forming a unit cell with a chloride ion in the center; or as simple Cs+ Cl−ions. cubic unit cells formed by ions overlapping unit cells formed by Cesium ions and chloride ions touch along the body diagonals of the unit cells. One cesium ion and one chloride ion are present per unit cell, giving the l:l stoichiometry required by the formula for cesium chloride. Note that there is no lattice point in the center of the cell, and CsCl is not a BCC structure because a cesium ion is not identical to a chloride ion. Figure 10.59 Ionic compounds with similar-sized cations and anions, such as CsCl, usually form a simple cubic structure. They can be described by unit cells with either cations at the corners or anions at the corners. We have said that the location of lattice points is arbitrary.

The two unit cells are different, but they describe identical structures. When an ionic compound is composed of a 1:1 ratio of cations and anions that differ significantly in size, it typically Figure 10.60. crystallizes with an FCC unit cell, like that shown in Sodium chloride, NaCl, is an example of this, Na+ Cl−having with and radii of 102 pm and 181 pm, respectively. We can think of this as chloride ions forming an FCC cell, with sodium ions located in the octahedral holes in the middle of the cell edges and in the center of the cell. The sodium and chloride ions touch each other along the cell edges. The unit cell contains four sodium ions and four chloride ions, giving the 1:1 stoichiometry required by the formula, NaCl. Figure 10.60 Ionic compounds with anions that are much larger than cations, such as NaCl, usually form an FCC structure. They can be described by FCC unit cells with cations in the octahedral holes. Figure 10.61. The cubic form of zinc sulfide, zinc blende, also crystallizes in an FCC unit cell, as illustrated in This structure contains sulfide ions on the lattice points of an FCC lattice. (The arrangement of sulfide ions is identical to the arrangement of chloride ions in sodium chloride.) The radius of a zinc ion is only about 40% of the radius of a Zn2+ sulfide ion, so these small ions are located in alternating tetrahedral holes, that is, in one half of the tetrahedral holes. There are four zinc ions and four sulfide ions in the unit cell, giving the empirical formula ZnS.

Close Figure 10.62 examination of will reveal a simple cubic array of fluoride ions with calcium ions in one half of the cubic holes. The structure cannot be described in terms of a space lattice of points on the fluoride ions because the fluoride ions do not all have identical environments. The orientation of the four calcium ions about the fluoride ions differs. Figure 10.62 Calcium fluoride, CaF2, forms an FCC unit cell with calcium ions (green) at the lattice points and fluoride ions (red) occupying all of the tetrahedral sites between them. Calculation of Ionic Radii If we know the edge length of a unit cell of an ionic compound and the position of the ions in the cell, we can calculate ionic radii for the ions in the compound if we make assumptions about individual ionic shapes and contacts. Example 10.18 Calculation of Ionic Radii The edge length of the unit cell of LiCl (NaCl-like structure, FCC) is 0.514 nm or 5.14 Å. Assuming that Figure 10.60, the lithium ion is small enough so that the chloride ions are in contact, as in calculate the ionic radius for the chloride ion. Note: The length unit angstrom, Å, is often used to represent atomic-scale dimensions and is equivalent to 10−10 m.

Assuming anion-cation contact along the cell edge, calculate the radius of the potassium ion. The radius of the chloride ion is 1.82 Å. Answer: The radius of the potassium ion is 1.33 Å. It is important to realize that values for ionic radii calculated from the edge lengths of unit cells depend on numerous assumptions, such as a perfect spherical shape for ions, which are approximations at best. Hence, such calculated values are themselves approximate and comparisons cannot be pushed too far. Nevertheless, this method has proved useful for calculating ionic radii from experimental measurements such as X-ray crystallographic determinations. X-Ray Crystallography The size of the unit cell and the arrangement of atoms in a crystal may be determined from measurements of the diffraction of X-rays by the crystal, termed X-ray crystallography. Diffraction is the change in the direction of travel experienced by an electromagnetic wave when it encounters a physical barrier whose dimensions are comparable to those of the wavelength of the light. X-rays are electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths about as long as the distance between neighboring atoms in crystals (on the order of a few Å). When a beam of monochromatic X-rays strikes a crystal, its rays are scattered in all directions by the atoms within the crystal. When scattered waves traveling in the same direction encounter one another, they undergo interference, a process by which the waves combine to yield either an increase or a decrease in amplitude (intensity) depending upon Figure 10.63). the extent to which the combining waves’ maxima are separated (see Figure 10.63 Light waves occupying the same space experience interference, combining to yield waves of greater (a) or lesser (b) intensity, depending upon the separation of their maxima and minima. When X-rays of a certain wavelength, λ, are scattered by atoms in adjacent crystal planes separated by a distance, d, they may undergo constructive interference when the difference between the distances traveled by the two waves

This condition is satisfied when the angle of the diffracted beam, θ, is related to the wavelength and interatomic distance by the equation: nλ = 2d sin θ This relation is known as the Bragg equation in honor of W. H. Bragg, the English physicist who first explained Figure 10.64 this phenomenon. illustrates two examples of diffracted waves from the same two crystal planes. The figure on the left depicts waves diffracted at the Bragg angle, resulting in constructive interference, while that on the right shows diffraction and a different angle that does not satisfy the Bragg condition, resulting in destructive interference. Figure 10.64 The diffraction of X-rays scattered by the atoms within a crystal permits the determination of the distance between the atoms.

588 Chapter 10 | Liquids and Solids Portrait of a Chemist X-ray Crystallographer Rosalind Franklin The discovery of the structure of DNA in 1953 by Francis Crick and James Watson is one of the great achievements in the history of science. They were awarded the 1962 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, along with Maurice Wilkins, who provided experimental proof of DNA’s structure. British chemist Rosalind Franklin made invaluable contributions to this monumental achievement through her work in measuring X-ray diffraction images of DNA. Early in her career, Franklin’s research on the structure of coals proved helpful to the British war effort. After shifting her focus to biological systems in the early 1950s, Franklin and doctoral student Raymond Gosling discovered that DNA consists of two forms: a long, thin fiber formed when wet (type “B”) and a short, wide fiber formed when dried (type “A”). Her X-ray diffraction images of DNA (Figure 10.66) provided the crucial information that allowed Watson and Crick to confirm that DNA forms a double helix, and to determine details of its size and structure. Franklin also conducted pioneering research on viruses and the RNA that contains their genetic information, uncovering new information that radically changed the body of knowledge in the field. After developing ovarian cancer, Franklin continued to work until her death in 1958 at age 37. Among many posthumous recognitions of her work, the Chicago Medical School of Finch University of Health Sciences changed its name to the Rosalind Franklin University of Medicine and Science in 2004, and adopted an image of her famous X-ray diffraction image of DNA as its official university logo. Figure 10.66 This illustration shows an X-ray diffraction image similar to the one Franklin found in her research.

In a liquid, intermolecular attractive forces hold the molecules in contact, although they still have sufficient KE to move past each other. Intermolecular attractive forces, collectively referred to as van der Waals forces, are responsible for the behavior of liquids and solids and are electrostatic in nature. Dipole-dipole attractions result from the electrostatic attraction of the partial negative end of one dipolar molecule for the partial positive end of another. The temporary dipole that results from the motion of the electrons in an atom can induce a dipole in an adjacent atom and give rise to the London dispersion force. London forces increase with increasing molecular size. Hydrogen bonds are a special type of dipole- dipole attraction that results when hydrogen is bonded to one of the three most electronegative elements: F, O, or N. 10.2 Properties of Liquids The intermolecular forces between molecules in the liquid state vary depending upon their chemical identities and result in corresponding variations in various physical properties. Cohesive forces between like molecules are responsible for a liquid’s viscosity (resistance to flow) and surface tension (elasticity of a liquid surface). Adhesive forces between the molecules of a liquid and different molecules composing a surface in contact with the liquid are responsible for phenomena such as surface wetting and capillary rise.

592 Chapter 10 | Liquids and Solids 10.3 Phase Transitions Phase transitions are processes that convert matter from one physical state into another. There are six phase transitions between the three phases of matter. Melting, vaporization, and sublimation are all endothermic processes, requiring an input of heat to overcome intermolecular attractions. The reciprocal transitions of freezing, condensation, and deposition are all exothermic processes, involving heat as intermolecular attractive forces are established or strengthened. The temperatures at which phase transitions occur are determined by the relative strengths of intermolecular attractions and are, therefore, dependent on the chemical identity of the substance. 10.4 Phase Diagrams The temperature and pressure conditions at which a substance exists in solid, liquid, and gaseous states are summarized in a phase diagram for that substance. Phase diagrams are combined plots of three pressure-temperature equilibrium curves: solid-liquid, liquid-gas, and solid-gas. These curves represent the relationships between phase- transition temperatures and pressures. The point of intersection of all three curves represents the substance’s triple point—the temperature and pressure at which all three phases are in equilibrium. At pressures below the triple point, a substance cannot exist in the liquid state, regardless of its temperature. The terminus of the liquid-gas curve represents the substance’s critical point, the pressure and temperature above which a liquid phase cannot exist. 10.5 The Solid State of Matter Some substances form crystalline solids consisting of particles in a very organized structure; others form amorphous (noncrystalline) solids with an internal structure that is not ordered. The main types of crystalline solids are ionic solids, metallic solids, covalent network solids, and molecular solids. The properties of the different kinds of crystalline solids are due to the types of particles of which they consist, the arrangements of the particles, and the strengths of the attractions between them. Because their particles experience identical attractions, crystalline solids have distinct melting temperatures; the particles in amorphous solids experience a range of interactions, so they soften gradually and melt over a range of temperatures. Some crystalline solids have defects in the definite repeating pattern of their particles. These defects (which include vacancies, atoms or ions not in the regular positions, and impurities) change physical properties such as electrical conductivity, which is exploited in the silicon crystals used to manufacture computer chips. 10.6 Lattice Structures in Crystalline Solids The structures of crystalline metals and simple ionic compounds can be described in terms of packing of spheres. Metal atoms can pack in hexagonal closest-packed structures, cubic closest-packed structures, body-centered structures, and simple cubic structures. The anions in simple ionic structures commonly adopt one of these structures, and the cations occupy the spaces remaining between the anions. Small cations usually occupy tetrahedral holes in a closest-packed array of anions. Larger cations usually occupy octahedral holes. Still larger cations can occupy cubic holes in a simple cubic array of anions. The structure of a solid can be described by indicating the size and shape of a unit cell and the contents of the cell. The type of structure and dimensions of the unit cell can be determined by X-ray diffraction measurements. Exercises 10.1 Intermolecular Forces 1.

Marine life depends on the specific chemical composition of the complex mixture we know as seawater. (credit: modification of work by “USFWS – Pacific Region”/Wikimedia Commons) Chapter Outline 11.1 The Dissolution Process 11.2 Electrolytes 11.3 Solubility 11.4 Colligative Properties 11.5 Colloids Introduction Coral reefs are home to about 25% of all marine species. They are being threatened by climate change, oceanic acidification, and water pollution, all of which change the composition of the solution we know as seawater. Dissolved oxygen in seawater is critical for sea creatures, but as the oceans warm, oxygen becomes less soluble. As the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere increases, the concentration of carbon dioxide in the oceans increases, contributing to oceanic acidification. Coral reefs are particularly sensitive to the acidification of the ocean, since the exoskeletons of the coral polyps are soluble in acidic solutions. Humans contribute to the changing of seawater composition by allowing agricultural runoff and other forms of pollution to affect our oceans. Solutions are crucial to the processes that sustain life and to many other processes involving chemical reactions. In this chapter, we will consider the nature of solutions, and examine factors that determine whether a solution will form and what properties it may have. In addition, we will discuss colloids—systems that resemble solutions but consist of dispersions of particles somewhat larger than ordinary molecules or ions.

604 Chapter 11 | Solutions and Colloids 11.1 The Dissolution Process By the end of this section, you will be able to: Describe the basic properties of solutions and how they form • Predict whether a given mixture will yield a solution based on molecular properties of its components • Explain why some solutions either produce or absorb heat when they form • An earlier chapter of this text introduced solutions, defined as homogeneous mixtures of two or more substances. Often, one component of a solution is present at a significantly greater concentration, in which case it is called the solvent. The other components of the solution present in relatively lesser concentrations are called solutes. Sugar is a covalent solid composed of sucrose molecules, C12H22O11. When this compound dissolves in water, its molecules become uniformly distributed among the molecules of water: O11(aq) C12 H22 O11(s) ⟶C12 H22 The subscript “aq” in the equation signifies that the sucrose molecules are solutes and are therefore individually dispersed throughout the aqueous solution (water is the solvent). Although sucrose molecules are heavier than water molecules, they remain dispersed throughout the solution; gravity does not cause them to “settle out” over time. K+, Potassium dichromate, K2Cr2O7, is an ionic compound composed of colorless potassium ions, and orange 2−. Cr2 O7 dichromate ions, When a small amount of solid potassium chromate is added to water, the compound dissolves and dissociates to yield potassium ions and dichromate ions uniformly distributed throughout the mixture (Figure 11.2), as indicated in this equation: ⟶2K+(aq) K2 Cr2 O7(s) + Cr2 O7(aq) As for the mixture of sugar and water, this mixture is also an aqueous solution. Its solutes, potassium and dichromate ions, remain individually dispersed among the solvent (water) molecules. Figure 11.2 When potassium dichromate (K2Cr2O7) is mixed with water, it forms a homogeneous orange solution.

The dissolved solute in a solution will not settle out or separate from the solvent. • The composition of a solution, or the concentrations of its components, can be varied continuously, within • limits. The Formation of Solutions The formation of a solution is an example of a spontaneous process, a process that occurs under specified conditions without the requirement of energy from some external source. Sometimes we stir a mixture to speed up the dissolution process, but this is not necessary; a homogeneous solution would form if we waited long enough. The topic of spontaneity is critically important to the study of chemical thermodynamics and is treated more thoroughly in a later chapter of this text. For purposes of this chapter’s discussion, it will suffice to consider two criteria that favor, but do not guarantee, the spontaneous formation of a solution: a decrease in the internal energy of the system (an exothermic change, as discussed in the previous chapter on 1. thermochemistry) an increase in the disorder in the system (which indicates an increase in the entropy of the system, as you will 2. learn about in the later chapter on thermodynamics) In the process of dissolution, an internal energy change often, but not always, occurs as heat is absorbed or evolved. An increase in disorder always results when a solution forms. 1. If bubbles of gas are observed within the liquid, the mixture is not homogeneous and, thus, not a solution. 

--- Page 614 ---
606 Chapter 11 | Solutions and Colloids When the strengths of the intermolecular forces of attraction between solute and solvent species in a solution are no different than those present in the separated components, the solution is formed with no accompanying energy change. Such a solution is called an ideal solution. A mixture of ideal gases (or gases such as helium and argon, which closely approach ideal behavior) is an example of an ideal solution, since the entities comprising these gases experience no significant intermolecular attractions. When containers of helium and argon are connected, the gases spontaneously mix due to diffusion and form a solution (Figure 11.3). The formation of this solution clearly involves an increase in disorder, since the helium and argon atoms occupy a volume twice as large as that which each occupied before mixing. Figure 11.3 Samples of helium and argon spontaneously mix to give a solution in which the disorder of the atoms of the two gases is increased. Ideal solutions may also form when structurally similar liquids are mixed. For example, mixtures of the alcohols methanol (CH3OH) and ethanol (C2H5OH) form ideal solutions, as do mixtures of the hydrocarbons pentane, C5H12, Figure 11.3 and hexane, C6H14. Placing methanol and ethanol, or pentane and hexane, in the bulbs shown in will result in the same diffusion and subsequent mixing of these liquids as is observed for the He and Ar gases (although at a much slower rate), yielding solutions with no significant change in energy. Unlike a mixture of gases, however, the components of these liquid-liquid solutions do, indeed, experience intermolecular attractive forces. But since the molecules of the two substances being mixed are structurally very similar, the intermolecular attractive forces between like and unlike molecules are essentially the same, and the dissolution process, therefore, does not entail any appreciable increase or decrease in energy. These examples illustrate how diffusion alone can provide the driving force required to cause the spontaneous formation of a solution. In some cases, however, the relative magnitudes of intermolecular forces of attraction between solute and solvent species may prevent dissolution. Three types of intermolecular attractive forces are relevant to the dissolution process: solute-solute, solvent-solvent, Figure 11.4, and solute-solvent. As illustrated in the formation of a solution may be viewed as a stepwise process in which energy is consumed to overcome solute-solute and solvent-solvent attractions (endothermic processes) and released when solute-solvent attractions are established (an exothermic process referred to as solvation). The relative magnitudes of the energy changes associated with these stepwise processes determine whether the dissolution process overall will release or absorb energy. In some cases, solutions do not form because the energy required to separate solute and solvent species is so much greater than the energy released by solvation. https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

Chapter 11 | Solutions and Colloids 607 Figure 11.4 This schematic representation of dissolution shows a stepwise process involving the endothermic separation of solute and solvent species (Steps 1 and 2) and exothermic solvation (Step 3). (Figure 11.5). For example, cooking oils and water will not mix to any appreciable extent to yield solutions Hydrogen bonding is the dominant intermolecular attractive force present in liquid water; the nonpolar hydrocarbon molecules of cooking oils are not capable of hydrogen bonding, instead being held together by dispersion forces. Forming an oil-water solution would require overcoming the very strong hydrogen bonding in water, as well as the significantly strong dispersion forces between the relatively large oil molecules. And, since the polar water molecules and nonpolar oil molecules would not experience very strong intermolecular attraction, very little energy would be released by solvation. 

--- Page 616 ---
608 Chapter 11 | Solutions and Colloids Figure 11.5 A mixture of nonpolar cooking oil and polar water does not yield a solution. (credit: Gautam Dogra) On the other hand, a mixture of ethanol and water will mix in any proportions to yield a solution. In this case, both substances are capable of hydrogen bonding, and so the solvation process is sufficiently exothermic to compensate for the endothermic separations of solute and solvent molecules. As noted at the beginning of this module, spontaneous solution formation is favored, but not guaranteed, by exothermic dissolution processes. While many soluble compounds do, indeed, dissolve with the release of heat, some dissolve endothermically. Ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3) is one such example and is used to make instant cold Figure 11.6. packs for treating injuries like the one pictured in A thin-walled plastic bag of water is sealed inside a larger bag with solid NH4NO3. When the smaller bag is broken, a solution of NH4NO3 forms, absorbing heat from the surroundings (the injured area to which the pack is applied) and providing a cold compress that decreases swelling. Endothermic dissolutions such as this one require a greater energy input to separate the solute species than is recovered when the solutes are solvated, but they are spontaneous nonetheless due to the increase in disorder that accompanies formation of the solution. https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

These substances constitute an important class of compounds called electrolytes. Substances that do not yield ions when dissolved are called nonelectrolytes. If the physical or chemical process that generates the ions is essentially 100% efficient (all of the dissolved compound yields ions), then the substance is known as a strong 

--- Page 618 ---
610 Chapter 11 | Solutions and Colloids electrolyte. If only a relatively small fraction of the dissolved substance undergoes the ion-producing process, it is called a weak electrolyte. Substances may be identified as strong, weak, or nonelectrolytes by measuring the electrical conductance of an aqueous solution containing the substance. To conduct electricity, a substance must contain freely mobile, charged species. Most familiar is the conduction of electricity through metallic wires, in which case the mobile, charged entities are electrons. Solutions may also conduct electricity if they contain dissolved ions, with conductivity increasing as ion concentration increases. Applying a voltage to electrodes immersed in a solution permits assessment of the relative concentration of dissolved ions, either quantitatively, by measuring the electrical current flow, or (Figure 11.7). qualitatively, by observing the brightness of a light bulb included in the circuit Figure 11.7 Solutions of nonelectrolytes such as ethanol do not contain dissolved ions and cannot conduct electricity. Solutions of electrolytes contain ions that permit the passage of electricity. The conductivity of an electrolyte solution is related to the strength of the electrolyte. Ionic Electrolytes Figure 11.8. Water and other polar molecules are attracted to ions, as shown in The electrostatic attraction between an ion and a molecule with a dipole is called an ion-dipole attraction. These attractions play an important role in the dissolution of ionic compounds in water. https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

Chapter 11 | Solutions and Colloids 611 Figure 11.8 As potassium chloride (KCl) dissolves in water, the ions are hydrated. The polar water molecules are K+ Cl−ions. attracted by the charges on the and Water molecules in front of and behind the ions are not shown. When ionic compounds dissolve in water, the ions in the solid separate and disperse uniformly throughout the solution because water molecules surround and solvate the ions, reducing the strong electrostatic forces between them. This process represents a physical change known as dissociation. Under most conditions, ionic compounds will dissociate nearly completely when dissolved, and so they are classified as strong electrolytes. Let us consider what happens at the microscopic level when we add solid KCl to water. Ion-dipole forces attract the positive (hydrogen) end of the polar water molecules to the negative chloride ions at the surface of the solid, and they attract the negative (oxygen) ends to the positive potassium ions. The water molecules penetrate between individual K+ Cl−ions and and surround them, reducing the strong interionic forces that bind the ions together and letting them Figure 11.8 move off into solution as solvated ions, as shows. The reduction of the electrostatic attraction permits the independent motion of each hydrated ion in a dilute solution, resulting in an increase in the disorder of the system as the ions change from their fixed and ordered positions in the crystal to mobile and much more disordered states in solution. This increased disorder is responsible for the dissolution of many ionic compounds, including KCl, which dissolve with absorption of heat. In other cases, the electrostatic attractions between the ions in a crystal are so large, or the ion-dipole attractive forces between the ions and water molecules are so weak, that the increase in disorder cannot compensate for the energy required to separate the ions, and the crystal is insoluble. Such is the case for compounds such as calcium carbonate (limestone), calcium phosphate (the inorganic component of bone), and iron oxide (rust).

612 Chapter 11 | Solutions and Colloids Covalent Electrolytes Pure water is an extremely poor conductor of electricity because it is only very slightly ionized—only about two out of every 1 billion molecules ionize at 25 °C. Water ionizes when one molecule of water gives up a proton to another molecule of water, yielding hydronium and hydroxide ions. O+(aq) OH−(aq) O(l) O(l) H2 + H2 ⇌H3 + In some cases, we find that solutions prepared from covalent compounds conduct electricity because the solute molecules react chemically with the solvent to produce ions. For example, pure hydrogen chloride is a gas consisting of covalent HCl molecules. This gas contains no ions. However, when we dissolve hydrogen chloride in water, we find that the solution is a very good conductor. The water molecules play an essential part in forming ions: Solutions of hydrogen chloride in many other solvents, such as benzene, do not conduct electricity and do not contain ions. H+ Hydrogen chloride is an acid, and so its molecules react with water, transferring ions to form hydronium ions (H3O+) (Cl−): and chloride ions This reaction is essentially 100% complete for HCl (i.e., it is a strong acid and, consequently, a strong electrolyte). Likewise, weak acids and bases that only react partially generate relatively low concentrations of ions when dissolved in water and are classified as weak electrolytes. The reader may wish to review the discussion of strong and weak acids provided in the earlier chapter of this text on reaction classes and stoichiometry. 11.3 Solubility By the end of this module, you will be able to: Describe the effects of temperature and pressure on solubility • State Henry’s law and use it in calculations involving the solubility of a gas in a liquid • Explain the degrees of solubility possible for liquid-liquid solutions • Imagine adding a small amount of salt to a glass of water, stirring until all the salt has dissolved, and then adding a bit more. You can repeat this process until the salt concentration of the solution reaches its natural limit, a limit determined primarily by the relative strengths of the solute-solute, solute-solvent, and solvent-solvent attractive forces discussed in the previous two modules of this chapter. You can be certain that you have reached this limit because, no matter how long you stir the solution, undissolved salt remains. The concentration of salt in the solution at this point is known as its solubility. The solubility of a solute in a particular solvent is the maximum concentration that may be achieved under given conditions when the dissolution process is at equilibrium. Referring to the example of salt in water: ⇌Na+(aq) Cl−(aq) NaCl(s) + When a solute’s concentration is equal to its solubility, the solution is said to be saturated with that solute. If the solute’s concentration is less than its solubility, the solution is said to be unsaturated. A solution that contains a relatively low concentration of solute is called dilute, and one with a relatively high concentration is called concentrated.

Support for the simultaneous occurrence of the dissolution and precipitation processes is provided by noting that the number and sizes of the undissolved salt crystals will change over time, though their combined mass will remain the same. Link to Learning Use this interactive simulation (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/16Phetsoluble) to prepare various saturated solutions. Solutions may be prepared in which a solute concentration exceeds its solubility. Such solutions are said to be supersaturated, and they are interesting examples of nonequilibrium states. For example, the carbonated beverage in an open container that has not yet “gone flat” is supersaturated with carbon dioxide gas; given time, the CO2 concentration will decrease until it reaches its equilibrium value.

Solutions of Gases in Liquids In an earlier module of this chapter, the effect of intermolecular attractive forces on solution formation was discussed. The chemical structures of the solute and solvent dictate the types of forces possible and, consequently, are important factors in determining solubility. For example, under similar conditions, the water solubility of oxygen is approximately three times greater than that of helium, but 100 times less than the solubility of chloromethane, CHCl3. Considering the role of the solvent’s chemical structure, note that the solubility of oxygen in the liquid hydrocarbon hexane, C6H14, is approximately 20 times greater than it is in water. Other factors also affect the solubility of a given substance in a given solvent. Temperature is one such factor, with (Figure 11.9). gas solubility typically decreasing as temperature increases This is one of the major impacts resulting from the thermal pollution of natural bodies of water.

614 Chapter 11 | Solutions and Colloids Figure 11.9 The solubilities of these gases in water decrease as the temperature increases. All solubilities were measured with a constant pressure of 101.3 kPa (1 atm) of gas above the solutions. When the temperature of a river, lake, or stream is raised abnormally high, usually due to the discharge of hot water from some industrial process, the solubility of oxygen in the water is decreased. Decreased levels of dissolved oxygen may have serious consequences for the health of the water’s ecosystems and, in severe cases, can result in large-scale (Figure 11.10). fish kills Figure 11.10 (a) The small bubbles of air in this glass of chilled water formed when the water warmed to room temperature and the solubility of its dissolved air decreased. (b) The decreased solubility of oxygen in natural waters subjected to thermal pollution can result in large-scale fish kills. (credit a: modification of work by Liz West; credit b: modification of work by U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service) The solubility of a gaseous solute is also affected by the partial pressure of solute in the gas to which the solution is exposed. Gas solubility increases as the pressure of the gas increases. Carbonated beverages provide a nice illustration of this relationship. The carbonation process involves exposing the beverage to a relatively high pressure of carbon https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

When the beverage container is opened, a familiar hiss is heard as the carbon dioxide gas pressure is released, and some of (Figure 11.11). the dissolved carbon dioxide is typically seen leaving solution in the form of small bubbles At this point, the beverage is supersaturated with carbon dioxide and, with time, the dissolved carbon dioxide concentration will decrease to its equilibrium value and the beverage will become “flat.” Figure 11.11 Opening the bottle of carbonated beverage reduces the pressure of the gaseous carbon dioxide above the beverage. The solubility of CO2 is thus lowered, and some dissolved carbon dioxide may be seen leaving the solution as small gas bubbles. (credit: modification of work by Derrick Coetzee) For many gaseous solutes, the relation between solubility, Cg, and partial pressure, Pg, is a proportional one: Cg = kPg where k is a proportionality constant that depends on the identities of the gaseous solute and solvent, and on the solution temperature. This is a mathematical statement of Henry’s law: The quantity of an ideal gas that dissolves in a definite volume of liquid is directly proportional to the pressure of the gas. Example 11.1 Application of Henry’s Law At 20 °C, the concentration of dissolved oxygen in water exposed to gaseous oxygen at a partial pressure of 10−3 L−1. × 101.3 kPa (760 torr) is 1.38 mol Use Henry’s law to determine the solubility of oxygen when its partial pressure is 20.7 kPa (155 torr), the approximate pressure of oxygen in earth’s atmosphere.

Because we know both Cg and Pg, we can rearrange this expression to solve for k.

Use Henry’s law to determine the solubility of this gaseous solute when its pressure is 101.3 kPa (760 torr). 10−3 × Answer: 7.25 g Chemistry in Everyday Life Decompression Sickness or “The Bends” Decompression sickness (DCS), or “the bends,” is an effect of the increased pressure of the air inhaled by scuba divers when swimming underwater at considerable depths. In addition to the pressure exerted by the atmosphere, divers are subjected to additional pressure due to the water above them, experiencing an increase of approximately 1 atm for each 10 m of depth. Therefore, the air inhaled by a diver while submerged contains gases at the corresponding higher ambient pressure, and the concentrations of the gases dissolved in the diver’s blood are proportionally higher per Henry’s law. As the diver ascends to the surface of the water, the ambient pressure decreases and the dissolved gases becomes less soluble. If the ascent is too rapid, the gases escaping from the diver’s blood may form bubbles that can cause a variety of symptoms ranging from rashes and joint pain to paralysis and death. To avoid DCS, divers must ascend from depths at relatively slow speeds (10 or 20 m/min) or otherwise make several decompression stops, pausing for several minutes at given depths during the ascent. When these preventive measures are unsuccessful, divers with DCS are often provided hyperbaric oxygen therapy in pressurized vessels called decompression (or recompression) chambers (Figure 11.12). https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

Chapter 11 | Solutions and Colloids 617 Figure 11.12 (a) US Navy divers undergo training in a recompression chamber. (b) Divers receive hyperbaric oxygen therapy. Deviations from Henry’s law are observed when a chemical reaction takes place between the gaseous solute and the solvent. Thus, for example, the solubility of ammonia in water does not increase as rapidly with increasing pressure as predicted by the law because ammonia, being a base, reacts to some extent with water to form ammonium ions and hydroxide ions. Gases can form supersaturated solutions. If a solution of a gas in a liquid is prepared either at low temperature or under pressure (or both), then as the solution warms or as the gas pressure is reduced, the solution may become supersaturated. In 1986, more than 1700 people in Cameroon were killed when a cloud of gas, almost certainly carbon (Figure 11.13), dioxide, bubbled from Lake Nyos a deep lake in a volcanic crater. The water at the bottom of Lake Nyos is saturated with carbon dioxide by volcanic activity beneath the lake. It is believed that the lake underwent a turnover due to gradual heating from below the lake, and the warmer, less-dense water saturated with carbon dioxide reached the surface. Consequently, tremendous quantities of dissolved CO2 were released, and the colorless gas, which is denser than air, flowed down the valley below the lake and suffocated humans and animals living in the valley.

Ethanol, sulfuric acid, and ethylene glycol (popular for use as antifreeze, pictured in Figure 11.14) are examples of liquids that are completely miscible with water. Two-cycle motor oil is miscible with gasoline. Figure 11.14 Water and antifreeze are miscible; mixtures of the two are homogeneous in all proportions.

--- Page 627 ---
Chapter 11 | Solutions and Colloids 619 Liquids that mix with water in all proportions are usually polar substances or substances that form hydrogen bonds. For such liquids, the dipole-dipole attractions (or hydrogen bonding) of the solute molecules with the solvent molecules are at least as strong as those between molecules in the pure solute or in the pure solvent. Hence, the two kinds of molecules mix easily. Likewise, nonpolar liquids are miscible with each other because there is no appreciable difference in the strengths of solute-solute, solvent-solvent, and solute-solvent intermolecular attractions. The solubility of polar molecules in polar solvents and of nonpolar molecules in nonpolar solvents is, again, an illustration of the chemical axiom “like dissolves like.” Two liquids that do not mix to an appreciable extent are called immiscible. Layers are formed when we pour (Figure 11.15), immiscible liquids into the same container. Gasoline, oil benzene, carbon tetrachloride, some paints, and many other nonpolar liquids are immiscible with water. The attraction between the molecules of such nonpolar liquids and polar water molecules is ineffectively weak. The only strong attractions in such a mixture are between the water molecules, so they effectively squeeze out the molecules of the nonpolar liquid. The distinction between immiscibility and miscibility is really one of degrees, so that miscible liquids are of infinite mutual solubility, while liquids said to be immiscible are of very low (though not zero) mutual solubility. Figure 11.15 Water and oil are immiscible. Mixtures of these two substances will form two separate layers with the less dense oil floating on top of the water. (credit: “Yortw”/Flickr) Two liquids, such as bromine and water, that are of moderate mutual solubility are said to be partially miscible. Two partially miscible liquids usually form two layers when mixed. In the case of the bromine and water mixture, the upper layer is water, saturated with bromine, and the lower layer is bromine saturated with water. Since bromine is nonpolar, and, thus, not very soluble in water, the water layer is only slightly discolored by the bright orange bromine

Since the solubility of water in bromine is very low, there is no noticeable effect on the dark color of (Figure 11.16). the bromine layer Figure 11.16 Bromine (the deep orange liquid on the left) and water (the clear liquid in the middle) are partially miscible.

Chapter 11 | Solutions and Colloids 621 Figure 11.17 This graph shows how the solubility of several solids changes with temperature. The temperature dependence of solubility can be exploited to prepare supersaturated solutions of certain compounds. A solution may be saturated with the compound at an elevated temperature (where the solute is more soluble) and subsequently cooled to a lower temperature without precipitating the solute. The resultant solution contains solute at a concentration greater than its equilibrium solubility at the lower temperature (i.e., it is supersaturated) and is relatively stable. Precipitation of the excess solute can be initiated by adding a seed crystal (see the video in the Link to Learning earlier in this module) or by mechanically agitating the solution. Some hand warmers, such as the one Figure 11.18, pictured in take advantage of this behavior. Figure 11.18 This hand warmer produces heat when the sodium acetate in a supersaturated solution precipitates. Precipitation of the solute is initiated by a mechanical shockwave generated when the flexible metal disk within the solution is “clicked.” (credit: modification of work by “Velela”/Wikimedia Commons)

Many solution properties are dependent upon the chemical identity of the solute. Compared to pure water, a solution of hydrogen chloride is more acidic, a solution of ammonia is more basic, a solution of sodium chloride is more dense, and a solution of sucrose is more viscous. There are a few solution properties, however, that depend only upon the total concentration of solute species, regardless of their identities. These colligative properties include vapor pressure lowering, boiling point elevation, freezing point depression, and osmotic pressure. This small set of properties is of central importance to many natural phenomena and technological applications, as will be described in this module. Mole Fraction and Molality Several units commonly used to express the concentrations of solution components were introduced in an earlier chapter of this text, each providing certain benefits for use in different applications. For example, molarity (M) is a convenient unit for use in stoichiometric calculations, since it is defined in terms of the molar amounts of solute species: mol solute M = L solution Because solution volumes vary with temperature, molar concentrations will likewise vary. When expressed as molarity, the concentration of a solution with identical numbers of solute and solvent species will be different at different temperatures, due to the contraction/expansion of the solution. More appropriate for calculations involving many colligative properties are mole-based concentration units whose values are not dependent on temperature. Two such units are mole fraction (introduced in the previous chapter on gases) and molality. The mole fraction, X, of a component is the ratio of its molar amount to the total number of moles of all solution components: mol A XA = total mol of all components Molality is a concentration unit defined as the ratio of the numbers of moles of solute to the mass of the solvent in kilograms: mol solute m = kg solvent https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at 

--- Page 631 ---
Chapter 11 | Solutions and Colloids 623 Since these units are computed using only masses and molar amounts, they do not vary with temperature and, thus, are better suited for applications requiring temperature-independent concentrations, including several colligative properties, as will be described in this chapter module.

Solution (a) The mole fraction of ethylene glycol may be computed by first deriving molar amounts of both solution components and then substituting these amounts into the unit definition. 1 mol C2 H4(OH)2 mol C2 H4(OH)2 = 2220 g × = 35.8 mol C2 H4(OH)2 62.07 g C2 H4(OH)2 1 mol H2 O mol H2 O = 2000 g × = 11.1 mol H2 O 18.02 g H2 O 35.8 mol C2 H4(OH)2 = 0.763 Xethylene = glycol (35.8 11.1) + mol total Notice that mole fraction is a dimensionless property, being the ratio of properties with identical units (moles). (b) To find molality, we need to know the moles of the solute and the mass of the solvent (in kg). First, use the given mass of ethylene glycol and its molar mass to find the moles of solute: ⎛ ⎞ mol C2 H2(OH)2 ⎝ ⎠= 2220 g C2 H4(OH)2 35.8 mol C2 H4(OH)2 62.07 g Then, convert the mass of the water from grams to kilograms: O⎛ ⎞ 1 kg ⎝ ⎠= 2000 g H2 2 kg H2 O 1000 g Finally, calculate molarity per its definition: mol solute molality = kg solvent 35.8 mol C2 H4(OH)2 molality = 2 kg H2 O molality = 17.9 m Check Your Learning What are the mole fraction and molality of a solution that contains 0.850 g of ammonia, NH3, dissolved in 125 g of water? 10−3; × Answer: 7.14 0.399 m Example 11.3

Solution Converting from one concentration unit to another is accomplished by first comparing the two unit definitions. In this case, both units have the same numerator (moles of solute) but different denominators. The provided molal concentration may be written as: 3.0 mol NaCl 1.0 kg H2 O The numerator for this solution’s mole fraction is, therefore, 3.0 mol NaCl.

What is the molal concentration, m, of iodine in this solution? Answer: 1.50 m Vapor Pressure Lowering As described in the chapter on liquids and solids, the equilibrium vapor pressure of a liquid is the pressure exerted by its gaseous phase when vaporization and condensation are occurring at equal rates: liquid ⇌gas Dissolving a nonvolatile substance in a volatile liquid results in a lowering of the liquid’s vapor pressure. This phenomenon can be rationalized by considering the effect of added solute molecules on the liquid's vaporization and condensation processes. To vaporize, solvent molecules must be present at the surface of the solution. The presence of solute decreases the surface area available to solvent molecules and thereby reduces the rate of solvent vaporization. Since the rate of condensation is unaffected by the presence of solute, the net result is that the vaporization- condensation equilibrium is achieved with fewer solvent molecules in the vapor phase (i.e., at a lower vapor pressure) (Figure 11.19). While this kinetic interpretation is useful, it does not account for several important aspects of the colligative nature of vapor pressure lowering. A more rigorous explanation involves the property of entropy, a topic of discussion in a later text chapter on thermodynamics. For purposes of understanding the lowering of a liquid's vapor pressure, it is adequate to note that the greater entropy of a solution in comparison to its separate solvent and solute https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

Chapter 11 | Solutions and Colloids 625 serves to effectively stabilize the solvent molecules and hinder their vaporization. A lower vapor pressure results, and a correspondingly higher boiling point as described in the next section of this module. Figure 11.19 The presence of nonvolatile solutes lowers the vapor pressure of a solution by impeding the evaporation of solvent molecules. The relationship between the vapor pressures of solution components and the concentrations of those components is described by Raoult’s law: The partial pressure exerted by any component of an ideal solution is equal to the vapor pressure of the pure component multiplied by its mole fraction in the solution. PA = XAPA° PA° where PA is the partial pressure exerted by component A in the solution, is the vapor pressure of pure A, and XA is the mole fraction of A in the solution. (Mole fraction is a concentration unit introduced in the chapter on gases.) Recalling that the total pressure of a gaseous mixture is equal to the sum of partial pressures for all its components (Dalton’s law of partial pressures), the total vapor pressure exerted by a solution containing i components is ∑ ∑ Psolution = Pi = XiPi° i i A nonvolatile substance is one whose vapor pressure is negligible (P° ≈0), and so the vapor pressure above a solution containing only nonvolatile solutes is due only to the solvent: Psolution = Xsolvent Psolvent ° Example 11.4

The vapor pressure of pure ethanol is 0.178 atm at 40 °C. Glycerin is essentially nonvolatile at this temperature.

If the vapor pressure of pure water at 25 °C is 23.7 torr, what is the vapor pressure of the solution? Answer: 23.4 torr Elevation of the Boiling Point of a Solvent As described in the chapter on liquids and solids, the boiling point of a liquid is the temperature at which its vapor pressure is equal to ambient atmospheric pressure. Since the vapor pressure of a solution is lowered due to the presence of nonvolatile solutes, it stands to reason that the solution’s boiling point will subsequently be increased. Compared to pure solvent, a solution, therefore, will require a higher temperature to achieve any given vapor pressure, including one equivalent to that of the surrounding atmosphere. The increase in boiling point observed when nonvolatile solute is dissolved in a solvent, ΔTb, is called boiling point elevation and is directly proportional to the molal concentration of solute species: ΔTb = Kb m where Kb is the boiling point elevation constant, or the ebullioscopic constant and m is the molal concentration (molality) of all solute species. Boiling point elevation constants are characteristic properties that depend on the identity of the solvent.

632 Chapter 11 | Solutions and Colloids Chemistry in Everyday Life Colligative Properties and De-Icing Sodium chloride and its group 2 analogs calcium and magnesium chloride are often used to de-ice roadways and sidewalks, due to the fact that a solution of any one of these salts will have a freezing point lower than 0 °C, the freezing point of pure water. The group 2 metal salts are frequently mixed with the cheaper and more readily available sodium chloride (“rock salt”) for use on roads, since they tend to be somewhat less corrosive than the NaCl, and they provide a larger depression of the freezing point, since they dissociate to yield three particles per formula unit, rather than two particles like the sodium chloride. Because these ionic compounds tend to hasten the corrosion of metal, they would not be a wise choice to use in antifreeze for the radiator in your car or to de-ice a plane prior to takeoff. For these applications, covalent compounds, such as ethylene or propylene glycol, are often used. The glycols used in radiator fluid not only lower the freezing point of the liquid, but they elevate the boiling point, making the fluid useful in both winter and summer. Heated glycols are often sprayed onto the surface of airplanes prior to takeoff in inclement weather in the winter to remove ice that has already formed and prevent the formation of more ice, which would be particularly dangerous if formed on the control surfaces of the aircraft (Figure 11.23). Figure 11.23 Freezing point depression is exploited to remove ice from (a) roadways and (b) the control surfaces of aircraft. Phase Diagram for an Aqueous Solution of a Nonelectrolyte The colligative effects on vapor pressure, boiling point, and freezing point described in the previous section are conveniently summarized by comparing the phase diagrams for a pure liquid and a solution derived from that liquid.

--- Page 641 ---
Chapter 11 | Solutions and Colloids 633 Figure 11.24 These phase diagrams show water (solid curves) and an aqueous solution of nonelectrolyte (dashed curves). The liquid-vapor curve for the solution is located beneath the corresponding curve for the solvent, depicting the vapor pressure lowering, ΔP, that results from the dissolution of nonvolatile solute. Consequently, at any given pressure, the solution’s boiling point is observed at a higher temperature than that for the pure solvent, reflecting the boiling point elevation, ΔTb, associated with the presence of nonvolatile solute. The solid-liquid curve for the solution is displaced left of that for the pure solvent, representing the freezing point depression, ΔTb, that accompanies solution formation. Finally, notice that the solid-gas curves for the solvent and its solution are identical. This is the case for many solutions comprising liquid solvents and nonvolatile solutes. Just as for vaporization, when a solution of this sort is frozen, it is actually just the solvent molecules that undergo the liquid-to-solid transition, forming pure solid solvent that excludes solute species. The solid and gaseous phases, therefore, are composed solvent only, and so transitions between these phases are not subject to colligative effects. Osmosis and Osmotic Pressure of Solutions A number of natural and synthetic materials exhibit selective permeation, meaning that only molecules or ions of a certain size, shape, polarity, charge, and so forth, are capable of passing through (permeating) the material. Biological cell membranes provide elegant examples of selective permeation in nature, while dialysis tubing used to remove metabolic wastes from blood is a more simplistic technological example. Regardless of how they may be fabricated, these materials are generally referred to as semipermeable membranes. Figure 11.25, Consider the apparatus illustrated in in which samples of pure solvent and a solution are separated by a membrane that only solvent molecules may permeate. Solvent molecules will diffuse across the membrane in both directions. Since the concentration of solvent is greater in the pure solvent than the solution, these molecules will diffuse from the solvent side of the membrane to the solution side at a faster rate than they will in the reverse direction. The result is a net transfer of solvent molecules from the pure solvent to the solution. Diffusion-driven transfer of solvent molecules through a semipermeable membrane is a process known as osmosis. 

--- Page 642 ---
634 Chapter 11 | Solutions and Colloids Figure 11.25 Osmosis results in the transfer of solvent molecules from a sample of low (or zero) solute concentration to a sample of higher solute concentration. Figure 11.25, When osmosis is carried out in an apparatus like that shown in the volume of the solution increases as it becomes diluted by accumulation of solvent. This causes the level of the solution to rise, increasing its hydrostatic pressure (due to the weight of the column of solution in the tube) and resulting in a faster transfer of solvent molecules back to the pure solvent side. When the pressure reaches a value that yields a reverse solvent transfer rate equal to the osmosis rate, bulk transfer of solvent ceases. This pressure is called the osmotic pressure (Π) of the solution. The osmotic pressure of a dilute solution is related to its solute molarity, M, and absolute temperature, T, according to the equation Π = MRT where R is the universal gas constant.

Solution We can find the osmotic pressure, Π, using the formula Π = MRT, where T is on the Kelvin scale (310 K) and the value of R is expressed in appropriate units (0.08206 L atm/mol K). Π = MRT = 0.03 mol/L × 0.08206 L atm/mol K × 310 K = 7.6 atm Check Your Learning What is the osmotic pressure (atm) a solution with a volume of 0.750 L that contains 5.0 g of methanol, CH3OH, in water at 37 °C? Answer: 5.3 atm Figure 11.26, If a solution is placed in an apparatus like the one shown in applying pressure greater than the osmotic pressure of the solution reverses the osmosis and pushes solvent molecules from the solution into the pure solvent. This technique of reverse osmosis is used for large-scale desalination of seawater and on smaller scales to produce high-purity tap water for drinking. Figure 11.26 Applying a pressure greater than the osmotic pressure of a solution will reverse osmosis. Solvent molecules from the solution are pushed into the pure solvent.

636 Chapter 11 | Solutions and Colloids Chemistry in Everyday Life Reverse Osmosis Water Purification In the process of osmosis, diffusion serves to move water through a semipermeable membrane from a less concentrated solution to a more concentrated solution. Osmotic pressure is the amount of pressure that must be applied to the more concentrated solution to cause osmosis to stop. If greater pressure is applied, the water will go from the more concentrated solution to a less concentrated (more pure) solution. This is called reverse osmosis. Reverse osmosis (RO) is used to purify water in many applications, from desalination plants in coastal cities, to water-purifying machines in grocery stores (Figure 11.27), and smaller reverse- osmosis household units. With a hand-operated pump, small RO units can be used in third-world countries, disaster areas, and in lifeboats. Our military forces have a variety of generator-operated RO units that can be transported in vehicles to remote locations. Figure 11.27 Reverse osmosis systems for purifying drinking water are shown here on (a) small and (b) large scales. (credit a: modification of work by Jerry Kirkhart; credit b: modification of work by Willard J. Lathrop) Examples of osmosis are evident in many biological systems because cells are surrounded by semipermeable membranes. Carrots and celery that have become limp because they have lost water can be made crisp again by placing them in water. Water moves into the carrot or celery cells by osmosis. A cucumber placed in a concentrated salt solution loses water by osmosis and absorbs some salt to become a pickle. Osmosis can also affect animal cells. Solute concentrations are particularly important when solutions are injected into the body. Solutes in body cell fluids and blood serum give these solutions an osmotic pressure of approximately 7.7 atm. Solutions injected into the body must have the same osmotic pressure as blood serum; that is, they should be isotonic with blood serum. If a less concentrated solution, a hypotonic solution, is injected in sufficient quantity to dilute the blood serum, water from the diluted serum passes into the blood cells by osmosis, causing the cells to expand and rupture. This process is called hemolysis. When a more concentrated solution, a hypertonic solution, is injected, the cells lose water to the more Figure concentrated solution, shrivel, and possibly die in a process called crenation. These effects are illustrated in 11.28. https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

Consequently, we can use a measurement of one of these properties to determine the molar mass of the solute from the measurements.

For example, 1 mole of any nonelectrolyte dissolved in 1 kilogram of solvent produces the same lowering of the freezing point as does 1 mole of any other nonelectrolyte. However, 1 mole of sodium chloride (an electrolyte) forms 2 moles of ions when dissolved in solution. Each individual ion produces the same effect on the freezing point as a single molecule does. Example 11.11 The Freezing Point of a Solution of an Electrolyte The concentration of ions in seawater is approximately the same as that in a solution containing 4.2 g of NaCl dissolved in 125 g of water. Assume that each of the ions in the NaCl solution has the same effect on the freezing point of water as a nonelectrolyte molecule, and determine the freezing temperature the solution (which is approximately equal to the freezing temperature of seawater).

Check Your Learning Assume that each of the ions in calcium chloride, CaCl2, has the same effect on the freezing point of water as a nonelectrolyte molecule. Calculate the freezing point of a solution of 0.724 g of CaCl2 in 175 g of water. Answer: −0.208 °C Na+ Assuming complete dissociation, a 1.0 m aqueous solution of NaCl contains 1.0 mole of ions (1.0 mol and 1.0 Cl−) mol per each kilogram of water, and its freezing point depression is expected to be ΔTf = 2.0 mol ions/kg water × 1.86 °C kg water/mol ion = 3.7 °C. When this solution is actually prepared and its freezing point depression measured, however, a value of 3.4 °C is obtained. Similar discrepancies are observed for other ionic compounds, and the differences between the measured and expected colligative property values typically become more significant as solute concentrations increase. These observations suggest that the ions of sodium chloride (and other strong electrolytes) are not completely dissociated in solution. To account for this and avoid the errors accompanying the assumption of total dissociation, an experimentally measured parameter named in honor of Nobel Prize-winning German chemist Jacobus Henricus van’t Hoff is used. The van’t Hoff factor (i) is defined as the ratio of solute particles in solution to the number of formula units dissolved: moles of particles in solution i = moles of formula units dissolved Values for measured van’t Hoff factors for several solutes, along with predicted values assuming complete Table 11.3. dissociation, are shown in Expected and Observed van’t Hoff Factors for Several 0.050 m Aqueous Electrolyte Solutions Electrolyte Particles in Solution i (Predicted) i (Measured) 2 1.9 HCl H+, Cl− 2 1.9 NaCl Na+, Cl− 2− MgSO4 2 1.3 Mg2+, SO4 MgCl2 3 2.7 Mg2+, 2Cl− FeCl3 4 3.4 Fe3+, 3Cl− glucose[2] C12H22O11 1 1.0 Table 11.3 https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

Chapter 11 | Solutions and Colloids 641 In 1923, the chemists Peter Debye and Erich Hückel proposed a theory to explain the apparent incomplete ionization of strong electrolytes. They suggested that although interionic attraction in an aqueous solution is very greatly reduced by solvation of the ions and the insulating action of the polar solvent, it is not completely nullified. The residual (Figure 11.29). attractions prevent the ions from behaving as totally independent particles In some cases, a positive and negative ion may actually touch, giving a solvated unit called an ion pair. Thus, the activity, or the effective concentration, of any particular kind of ion is less than that indicated by the actual concentration. Ions become more and more widely separated the more dilute the solution, and the residual interionic attractions become less and less. Thus, in extremely dilute solutions, the effective concentrations of the ions (their activities) are essentially equal to Table 11.3 the actual concentrations. Note that the van’t Hoff factors for the electrolytes in are for 0.05 m solutions, at which concentration the value of i for NaCl is 1.9, as opposed to an ideal value of 2. Figure 11.29 Ions become more and more widely separated the more dilute the solution, and the residual interionic attractions become less. 11.5 Colloids By the end of this section, you will be able to: Describe the composition and properties of colloidal dispersions • List and explain several technological applications of colloids • As a child, you may have made suspensions such as mixtures of mud and water, flour and water, or a suspension of solid pigments in water, known as tempera paint. These suspensions are heterogeneous mixtures composed of relatively large particles that are visible (or that can be seen with a magnifying glass). They are cloudy, and the 2. A nonelectrolyte shown for comparison.

642 Chapter 11 | Solutions and Colloids suspended particles settle out after mixing. On the other hand, when we make a solution, we prepare a homogeneous mixture in which no settling occurs and in which the dissolved species are molecules or ions. Solutions exhibit completely different behavior from suspensions. A solution may be colored, but it is transparent, the molecules or ions are invisible, and they do not settle out on standing. A group of mixtures called colloids (or colloidal dispersions) (Figure 11.30). exhibit properties intermediate between those of suspensions and solutions The particles in a colloid are larger than most simple molecules; however, colloidal particles are small enough that they do not settle out upon standing. Figure 11.30 (a) A solution is a homogeneous mixture that appears clear, such as the saltwater in this aquarium. (b) In a colloid, such as milk, the particles are much larger but remain dispersed and do not settle. (c) A suspension, such as mud, is a heterogeneous mixture of suspended particles that appears cloudy and in which the particles can settle. (credit a photo: modification of work by Adam Wimsatt; credit b photo: modification of work by Melissa Wiese; credit c photo: modification of work by Peter Burgess) The particles in a colloid are large enough to scatter light, a phenomenon called the Tyndall effect. This can make Figure 11.31. colloidal mixtures appear cloudy or opaque, such as the searchlight beams shown in Clouds are colloidal mixtures. They are composed of water droplets that are much larger than molecules, but that are small enough that they do not settle out. https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

Chapter 11 | Solutions and Colloids 643 Figure 11.31 The paths of searchlight beams are made visible when light is scattered by colloidal-size particles in the air (fog, smoke, etc.). (credit: “Bahman”/Wikimedia Commons) The term “colloid”—from the Greek words kolla, meaning “glue,” and eidos, meaning “like”—was first used in 1861 by Thomas Graham to classify mixtures such as starch in water and gelatin. Many colloidal particles are aggregates of hundreds or thousands of molecules, but others (such as proteins and polymer molecules) consist of a single extremely large molecule. The protein and synthetic polymer molecules that form colloids may have molecular masses ranging from a few thousand to many million atomic mass units. Analogous to the identification of solution components as “solute” and “solvent,” the components of a colloid are likewise classified according to their relative amounts. The particulate component typically present in a relatively minor amount is called the dispersed phase and the substance or solution throughout which the particulate is dispersed is called the dispersion medium. Colloids may involve virtually any combination of physical states (gas in Table 11.4. liquid, liquid in solid, solid in gas, etc.), as illustrated by the examples of colloidal systems given in Examples of Colloidal Systems Dispersed Phase Dispersion Medium Common Examples Name solid gas smoke, dust — solid liquid starch in water, some inks, paints, milk of magnesia sol solid solid some colored gems, some alloys — liquid gas clouds, fogs, mists, sprays aerosol liquid liquid milk, mayonnaise, butter emulsion Table 11.4

Particles of colloidal size are formed by two methods: Dispersion methods: that is, by breaking down larger particles. For example, paint pigments are produced by 1. dispersing large particles by grinding in special mills. Condensation methods: that is, growth from smaller units, such as molecules or ions. For example, clouds 2. form when water molecules condense and form very small droplets. A few solid substances, when brought into contact with water, disperse spontaneously and form colloidal systems. Gelatin, glue, starch, and dehydrated milk powder behave in this manner. The particles are already of colloidal size; the water simply disperses them. Powdered milk particles of colloidal size are produced by dehydrating milk spray. Some atomizers produce colloidal dispersions of a liquid in air. We can prepare an emulsion by shaking together or blending two immiscible liquids. This breaks one liquid into droplets of colloidal size, which then disperse throughout the other liquid. Oil spills in the ocean may be difficult to clean up, partly because wave action can cause the oil and water to form an emulsion. In many emulsions, however, the dispersed phase tends to coalesce, form large drops, and separate. Therefore, emulsions are usually stabilized by an emulsifying agent, a substance that inhibits the coalescence of the dispersed liquid. For example, a little soap will stabilize an emulsion of kerosene in water. Milk is an emulsion of butterfat in water, with the protein casein as the emulsifying agent. Mayonnaise is an emulsion of oil in vinegar, with egg yolk components as the emulsifying agents. Condensation methods form colloidal particles by aggregation of molecules or ions. If the particles grow beyond the colloidal size range, drops or precipitates form, and no colloidal system results. Clouds form when water molecules aggregate and form colloid-sized particles. If these water particles coalesce to form adequately large water drops of liquid water or crystals of solid water, they settle from the sky as rain, sleet, or snow. Many condensation methods involve chemical reactions. We can prepare a red colloidal suspension of iron(III) hydroxide by mixing a concentrated solution of iron(III) chloride with hot water: Fe3+(s) O+(aq) 3Cl−(aq). 3Cl−(g) O(l) ⟶Fe(OH)3(aq) + H3 + + + 6H2 A colloidal gold sol results from the reduction of a very dilute solution of gold(III) chloride by a reducing agent such as formaldehyde, tin(II) chloride, or iron(II) sulfate: Au3+ 3e−⟶Au + Some gold sols prepared in 1857 are still intact (the particles have not coalesced and settled), illustrating the long- term stability of many colloids. https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

Chapter 11 | Solutions and Colloids 645 Soaps and Detergents Pioneers made soap by boiling fats with a strongly basic solution made by leaching potassium carbonate, K2CO3, from wood ashes with hot water. Animal fats contain polyesters of fatty acids (long-chain carboxylic acids). When animal fats are treated with a base like potassium carbonate or sodium hydroxide, glycerol and salts of fatty acids such as palmitic, oleic, and stearic acid are formed. The salts of fatty acids are called soaps. The sodium salt of stearic acid, sodium stearate, has the formula C17H35CO2Na and contains an uncharged nonpolar hydrocarbon chain, the −unit CO2 (Figure 11.32).

Figure 11.33 Detergents contain a nonpolar hydrocarbon end (blue) and an ionic end (red). The ionic end can be either a sulfate or a sulfonate. The length of the hydrocarbon end can vary from detergent to detergent. The cleaning action of soaps and detergents can be explained in terms of the structures of the molecules involved. The hydrocarbon (nonpolar) end of a soap or detergent molecule dissolves in, or is attracted to, nonpolar substances Figure 11.34. such as oil, grease, or dirt particles. The ionic end is attracted by water (polar), illustrated in As a result, the soap or detergent molecules become oriented at the interface between the dirt particles and the water so they act as a kind of bridge between two different kinds of matter, nonpolar and polar. Molecules such as this are termed amphiphilic since they have both a hydrophobic (“water-fearing”) part and a hydrophilic (“water-loving”) part. As a consequence, dirt particles become suspended as colloidal particles and are readily washed away.

Chemistry in Everyday Life Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill The blowout of the Deepwater Horizon oil drilling rig on April 20, 2010, in the Gulf of Mexico near Mississippi began the largest marine oil spill in the history of the petroleum. In the 87 days following the blowout, an estimated 4.9 million barrels (210 million gallons) of oil flowed from the ruptured well 5000 feet below the water’s surface. The well was finally declared sealed on September 19, 2010. Crude oil is immiscible with and less dense than water, so the spilled oil rose to the surface of the water. Floating booms, skimmer ships, and controlled burns were used to remove oil from the water’s surface in an attempt to protect beaches and wetlands along the Gulf coast. In addition to removal of the oil, attempts were also made to lessen its environmental impact by rendering it “soluble” (in the loose sense of the term) and thus allowing it to be diluted to hopefully less harmful levels by the vast volume of ocean water. This approach used 1.84 million gallons of the oil dispersant Corexit 9527, most of which was injected underwater at the site of the leak, with small amounts being sprayed on top of the spill. Corexit 9527 contains 2-butoxyethanol (C6H14O2), an amphiphilic molecule whose polar and nonpolar ends are useful for emulsifying oil into small droplets, increasing the surface area of the oil and making it more available to marine bacteria for digestion (Figure 11.35). While this approach avoids many of the immediate hazards that bulk oil poses to marine and coastal ecosystems, it introduces the possibility of long-term effects resulting from the introduction of the complex and potential toxic components of petroleum into the ocean’s food chain. A number of organizations are involved in monitoring the extended impact of this oil spill, including the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (visit this website (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/16gulfspill) for additional details). https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

A colloidal particle of iron(III) hydroxide, for example, does not contain enough hydroxide ions to compensate exactly for the positive charges on the iron(III) ions. Thus, each individual colloidal particle bears a positive charge, and the colloidal dispersion consists of charged colloidal particles and some free hydroxide ions, which keep the dispersion electrically neutral. Most metal hydroxide colloids have positive charges, whereas most metals and metal sulfides form negatively charged dispersions. All colloidal particles in any one system have charges of the same sign. This helps keep them dispersed because particles containing like charges repel each other. We can take advantage of the charge on colloidal particles to remove them from a variety of mixtures. If we place a colloidal dispersion in a container with charged electrodes, positively charged particles, such as iron(III) hydroxide particles, would move to the negative electrode. There, the colloidal particles lose their charge and coagulate as a precipitate. The carbon and dust particles in smoke are often colloidally dispersed and electrically charged. Frederick Cottrell, an American chemist, developed a process to remove these particles. Portrait of a Chemist

(credit b: modification of work by “SpLot”/Wikimedia Commons) Born in Oakland, CA in 1877, Frederick Cottrell devoured textbooks as if they were novels and graduated from high school at the age of 16. He then entered the University of California (UC), Berkeley, completing a Bachelor’s degree in three years. He saved money from his $1200 annual salary as a chemistry teacher at Oakland High School to fund his studies in chemistry in Berlin with Nobel prize winner Jacobus Henricus van’t Hoff, and in Leipzig with Wilhelm Ostwald, another Nobel awardee. After earning his PhD in physical chemistry, he returned to the United States to teach at UC Berkeley. He also consulted for the DuPont Company, where he developed the electrostatic precipitator, a device designed to curb air pollution by removing colloidal particles from air. Cottrell used the proceeds from his invention to fund a nonprofit research corporation to finance scientific research. The charged particles are attracted to highly charged electrodes, where they are neutralized and deposited as dust (Figure 11.37). This is one of the important methods used to clean up the smoke from a variety of industrial processes. The process is also important in the recovery of valuable products from the smoke and flue dust of smelters, furnaces, and kilns.

Gels (Figure 11.38). When we make gelatin, such as Jell-O, we are making a type of colloid Gelatin sets on cooling because the hot aqueous mixture of gelatin coagulates as it cools and the whole mass, including the liquid, sets to an extremely viscous body known as a gel, a colloid in which the dispersing medium is a solid and the dispersed phase is a liquid. It appears that the fibers of the dispersing medium form a complex three-dimensional network, the interstices being filled with the liquid medium or a dilute solution of the dispersing medium. Because the formation of a gel is accompanied by the taking up of water or some other solvent, the gel is said to be hydrated or solvated.

Chapter 11 | Solutions and Colloids 653 Summary 11.1 The Dissolution Process A solution forms when two or more substances combine physically to yield a mixture that is homogeneous at the molecular level. The solvent is the most concentrated component and determines the physical state of the solution. The solutes are the other components typically present at concentrations less than that of the solvent. Solutions may form endothermically or exothermically, depending upon the relative magnitudes of solute and solvent intermolecular attractive forces. Ideal solutions form with no appreciable change in energy. 11.2 Electrolytes Substances that dissolve in water to yield ions are called electrolytes. Electrolytes may be covalent compounds that chemically react with water to produce ions (for example, acids and bases), or they may be ionic compounds that dissociate to yield their constituent cations and anions, when dissolved. Dissolution of an ionic compound is facilitated by ion-dipole attractions between the ions of the compound and the polar water molecules. Soluble ionic substances and strong acids ionize completely and are strong electrolytes, while weak acids and bases ionize to only a small extent and are weak electrolytes. Nonelectrolytes are substances that do not produce ions when dissolved in water. 11.3 Solubility The extent to which one substance will dissolve in another is determined by several factors, including the types and relative strengths of intermolecular attractive forces that may exist between the substances’ atoms, ions, or molecules. This tendency to dissolve is quantified as substance’s solubility, its maximum concentration in a solution at equilibrium under specified conditions. A saturated solution contains solute at a concentration equal to its solubility. A supersaturated solution is one in which a solute’s concentration exceeds its solubility—a nonequilibrium (unstable) condition that will result in solute precipitation when the solution is appropriately perturbed. Miscible liquids are soluble in all proportions, and immiscible liquids exhibit very low mutual solubility. Solubilities for gaseous solutes decrease with increasing temperature, while those for most, but not all, solid solutes increase with temperature. The concentration of a gaseous solute in a solution is proportional to the partial pressure of the gas to which the solution is exposed, a relation known as Henry’s law. 11.4 Colligative Properties Properties of a solution that depend only on the concentration of solute particles are called colligative properties. They include changes in the vapor pressure, boiling point, and freezing point of the solvent in the solution. The magnitudes of these properties depend only on the total concentration of solute particles in solution, not on the type of particles. The total concentration of solute particles in a solution also determines its osmotic pressure. This is the pressure that must be applied to the solution to prevent diffusion of molecules of pure solvent through a semipermeable membrane into the solution. Ionic compounds may not completely dissociate in solution due to activity effects, in which case observed colligative effects may be less than predicted. 11.5 Colloids Colloids are mixtures in which one or more substances are dispersed as relatively large solid particles or liquid droplets throughout a solid, liquid, or gaseous medium. The particles of a colloid remain dispersed and do not settle due to gravity, and they are often electrically charged. Colloids are widespread in nature and are involved in many technological applications. Exercises 11.1 The Dissolution Process 1. How do solutions differ from compounds? From other mixtures? Figure 2.

Chapter 12 | Kinetics 661 Chapter 12 Kinetics Figure 12.1 An agama lizard basks in the sun. As its body warms, the chemical reactions of its metabolism speed up. Chapter Outline 12.1 Chemical Reaction Rates 12.2 Factors Affecting Reaction Rates 12.3 Rate Laws 12.4 Integrated Rate Laws 12.5 Collision Theory 12.6 Reaction Mechanisms 12.7 Catalysis Introduction The lizard in the photograph is not simply enjoying the sunshine or working on its tan. The heat from the sun’s rays is critical to the lizard’s survival. A warm lizard can move faster than a cold one because the chemical reactions that allow its muscles to move occur more rapidly at higher temperatures. In the absence of warmth, the lizard is an easy meal for predators. From baking a cake to determining the useful lifespan of a bridge, rates of chemical reactions play important roles in our understanding of processes that involve chemical changes. When planning to run a chemical reaction, we should ask at least two questions. The first is: “Will the reaction produce the desired products in useful quantities?” The second question is: “How rapidly will the reaction occur?” A reaction that takes 50 years to produce a product is about as useful as one that never gives a product at all. A third question is often asked when investigating reactions in greater detail: “What specific molecular-level processes take place as the reaction occurs?” Knowing the answer to this question is of practical importance when the yield or rate of a reaction needs to be controlled. The study of chemical kinetics concerns the second and third questions—that is, the rate at which a reaction yields products and the molecular-scale means by which a reaction occurs. In this chapter, we will examine the factors that

662 Chapter 12 | Kinetics influence the rates of chemical reactions, the mechanisms by which reactions proceed, and the quantitative techniques used to determine and describe the rate at which reactions occur. 12.1 Chemical Reaction Rates By the end of this section, you will be able to: Define chemical reaction rate • Derive rate expressions from the balanced equation for a given chemical reaction • Calculate reaction rates from experimental data • A rate is a measure of how some property varies with time. Speed is a familiar rate that expresses the distance traveled by an object in a given amount of time. Wage is a rate that represents the amount of money earned by a person working for a given amount of time. Likewise, the rate of a chemical reaction is a measure of how much reactant is consumed, or how much product is produced, by the reaction in a given amount of time. The rate of reaction is the change in the amount of a reactant or product per unit time. Reaction rates are therefore determined by measuring the time dependence of some property that can be related to reactant or product amounts. Rates of reactions that consume or produce gaseous substances, for example, are conveniently determined by measuring changes in volume or pressure. For reactions involving one or more colored substances, rates may be monitored via measurements of light absorption. For reactions involving aqueous electrolytes, rates may be measured via changes in a solution’s conductivity. For reactants and products in solution, their relative amounts (concentrations) are conveniently used for purposes of expressing reaction rates. If we measure the concentration of hydrogen peroxide, H2O2, in an aqueous solution, we find that it changes slowly over time as the H2O2 decomposes, according to the equation: 2H2 O2(aq) ⟶2H2 O(l) + O2(g) The rate at which the hydrogen peroxide decomposes can be expressed in terms of the rate of change of its concentration, as shown here: −change in concentration of reactant rate of decomposition of H2 O2 = time interval ⎡ ⎤ ⎡ ⎤ ⎣H2 O2 − ⎣H2 O2 ⎦t2 ⎦t1 = − t2 −t1 ⎡ ⎤ −Δ ⎣H2 O2 ⎦ = Δt This mathematical representation of the change in species concentration over time is the rate expression for the reaction. The brackets indicate molar concentrations, and the symbol delta (Δ) indicates “change in.” Thus, [H2 O2]t1 [H2 O2]t2 represents the molar concentration of hydrogen peroxide at some time t1; likewise, represents the molar concentration of hydrogen peroxide at a later time t2; and Δ[H2O2] represents the change in molar concentration of hydrogen peroxide during the time interval Δt (that is, t2 −t1). Since the reactant concentration decreases as the reaction proceeds, Δ[H2O2] is a negative quantity; we place a negative sign in front of the expression Figure 12.2 because reaction rates are, by convention, positive quantities. provides an example of data collected during the decomposition of H2O2. https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

To obtain the tabulated results for this decomposition, the concentration of hydrogen peroxide was measured every 6 hours over the course of a day at a constant temperature of 40 °C. Reaction rates were computed for each time interval by dividing the change in concentration by the corresponding time increment, as shown here for the first 6-hour period: −Δ[H2 O2] −(0.500 mol/L −1.000 mol/L) L−1 h−1 = = 0.0833 mol Δt (6.00 h −0.00 h) Notice that the reaction rates vary with time, decreasing as the reaction proceeds. Results for the last 6-hour period yield a reaction rate of: −Δ[H2 O2] −(0.0625 mol/L −0.125 mol/L) L−1 h−1 = = 0.0103 mol Δt (24.00 h −18.00 h) This behavior indicates the reaction continually slows with time. Using the concentrations at the beginning and end of a time period over which the reaction rate is changing results in the calculation of an average rate for the reaction over this time interval. At any specific time, the rate at which a reaction is proceeding is known as its instantaneous rate. The instantaneous rate of a reaction at “time zero,” when the reaction commences, is its initial rate. Consider the analogy of a car slowing down as it approaches a stop sign. The vehicle’s initial rate—analogous to the beginning of a chemical reaction—would be the speedometer reading at the moment the driver begins pressing the brakes (t0). A few moments later, the instantaneous rate at a specific moment—call it t1—would be somewhat slower, as indicated by the speedometer reading at that point in time. As time passes, the instantaneous rate will continue to fall until it reaches zero, when the car (or reaction) stops. Unlike instantaneous speed, the car’s average speed is not indicated by the speedometer; but it can be calculated as the ratio of the distance traveled to the time required to bring the vehicle to a complete stop (Δt). Like the decelerating car, the average rate of a chemical reaction will fall somewhere between its initial and final rates. The instantaneous rate of a reaction may be determined one of two ways. If experimental conditions permit the measurement of concentration changes over very short time intervals, then average rates computed as described earlier provide reasonably good approximations of instantaneous rates. Alternatively, a graphical procedure may be used that, in effect, yields the results that would be obtained if short time interval measurements were possible. If we plot the concentration of hydrogen peroxide against time, the instantaneous rate of decomposition of H2O2 at any time (Figure 12.3). t is given by the slope of a straight line that is tangent to the curve at that time We can use calculus to evaluating the slopes of such tangent lines, but the procedure for doing so is beyond the scope of this chapter.

664 Chapter 12 | Kinetics Figure 12.3 This graph shows a plot of concentration versus time for a 1.000 M solution of H2O2. The rate at any instant is equal to the opposite of the slope of a line tangential to this curve at that time. Tangents are shown at t = 0 h (“initial rate”) and at t = 10 h (“instantaneous rate” at that particular time). Chemistry in Everyday Life Reaction Rates in Analysis: Test Strips for Urinalysis Physicians often use disposable test strips to measure the amounts of various substances in a patient’s urine (Figure 12.4). These test strips contain various chemical reagents, embedded in small pads at various locations along the strip, which undergo changes in color upon exposure to sufficient concentrations of specific substances. The usage instructions for test strips often stress that proper read time is critical for optimal results. This emphasis on read time suggests that kinetic aspects of the chemical reactions occurring on the test strip are important considerations. The test for urinary glucose relies on a two-step process represented by the chemical equations shown here: C6 H12 O6 + O2 C6 H10 O6 + H2 O2 ⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯ → catalyst 2I− I2 + 2H2 O + O2 2H2 O2 + → ⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯ catalyst The first equation depicts the oxidation of glucose in the urine to yield glucolactone and hydrogen peroxide. The hydrogen peroxide produced subsequently oxidizes colorless iodide ion to yield brown iodine, which may be visually detected. Some strips include an additional substance that reacts with iodine to produce a more distinct color change. The two test reactions shown above are inherently very slow, but their rates are increased by special enzymes embedded in the test strip pad. This is an example of catalysis, a topic discussed later in this chapter. A typical glucose test strip for use with urine requires approximately 30 seconds for completion of the color-forming reactions. Reading the result too soon might lead one to conclude that the glucose concentration of the urine sample is lower than it actually is (a false-negative result). Waiting too long to assess the color change can lead to a false positive due to the slower (not catalyzed) oxidation of iodide ion by other substances found in urine. https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

(credit: Iqbal Osman) Relative Rates of Reaction The rate of a reaction may be expressed in terms of the change in the amount of any reactant or product, and may be simply derived from the stoichiometry of the reaction. Consider the reaction represented by the following equation: 2NH3(g) ⟶N2(g) + 3H2(g) The stoichiometric factors derived from this equation may be used to relate reaction rates in the same manner that they are used to related reactant and product amounts. The relation between the reaction rates expressed in terms of nitrogen production and ammonia consumption, for example, is: −Δmol NH3 1 mol N2 Δmol N2 × = Δt Δt 2 mol NH3 We can express this more simply without showing the stoichiometric factor’s units: Δmol NH3 Δmol N2 −1 = Δt Δt 2 Note that a negative sign has been added to account for the opposite signs of the two amount changes (the reactant amount is decreasing while the product amount is increasing). If the reactants and products are present in the same solution, the molar amounts may be replaced by concentrations: Δ[NH3] Δ[N2] −1 = Δt Δt 2 Similarly, the rate of formation of H2 is three times the rate of formation of N2 because three moles of H2 form during the time required for the formation of one mole of N2: Δ[H2] Δ[N2] 1 = Δt Δt 3 Figure 12.5 illustrates the change in concentrations over time for the decomposition of ammonia into nitrogen and hydrogen at 1100 °C. We can see from the slopes of the tangents drawn at t = 500 seconds that the instantaneous rates of change in the concentrations of the reactants and products are related by their stoichiometric factors. The rate of hydrogen production, for example, is observed to be three times greater than that for nitrogen production:

We can identify five factors that affect the rates of chemical reactions: the chemical nature of the reacting substances, the state of subdivision (one large lump versus many small particles) of the reactants, the temperature of the reactants, the concentration of the reactants, and the presence of a catalyst. 

--- Page 676 ---
668 Chapter 12 | Kinetics The Chemical Nature of the Reacting Substances The rate of a reaction depends on the nature of the participating substances. Reactions that appear similar may have different rates under the same conditions, depending on the identity of the reactants. For example, when small pieces of the metals iron and sodium are exposed to air, the sodium reacts completely with air overnight, whereas the iron is barely affected. The active metals calcium and sodium both react with water to form hydrogen gas and a base. Yet calcium reacts at a moderate rate, whereas sodium reacts so rapidly that the reaction is almost explosive. The State of Subdivision of the Reactants Except for substances in the gaseous state or in solution, reactions occur at the boundary, or interface, between two phases. Hence, the rate of a reaction between two phases depends to a great extent on the surface contact between them. A finely divided solid has more surface area available for reaction than does one large piece of the same substance. Thus a liquid will react more rapidly with a finely divided solid than with a large piece of the same solid. (Figure 12.6). For example, large pieces of iron react slowly with acids; finely divided iron reacts much more rapidly Large pieces of wood smolder, smaller pieces burn rapidly, and saw dust burns explosively. Figure 12.6 (a) Iron powder reacts rapidly with dilute hydrochloric acid and produces bubbles of hydrogen gas ⟶2FeCl3(aq) because the powder has a large total surface area: 2Fe(s) + 6HCl(aq) + 3H2(g). (b) An iron nail reacts more slowly.

Temperature of the Reactants Chemical reactions typically occur faster at higher temperatures. Food can spoil quickly when left on the kitchen counter. However, the lower temperature inside of a refrigerator slows that process so that the same food remains fresh for days. We use a burner or a hot plate in the laboratory to increase the speed of reactions that proceed slowly at ordinary temperatures. In many cases, an increase in temperature of only 10 °C will approximately double the rate of a reaction in a homogeneous system. https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

Chapter 12 | Kinetics 669 Concentrations of the Reactants The rates of many reactions depend on the concentrations of the reactants. Rates usually increase when the concentration of one or more of the reactants increases. For example, calcium carbonate (CaCO3) deteriorates as a result of its reaction with the pollutant sulfur dioxide. The rate of this reaction depends on the amount of sulfur dioxide (Figure 12.7). in the air An acidic oxide, sulfur dioxide combines with water vapor in the air to produce sulfurous acid in the following reaction: SO2(g) + H2 O(g) ⟶H2 SO3(aq) Calcium carbonate reacts with sulfurous acid as follows: CaCO3(s) + H2 SO3(aq) ⟶CaSO3(aq) + CO2(g) + H2 O(l) In a polluted atmosphere where the concentration of sulfur dioxide is high, calcium carbonate deteriorates more rapidly than in less polluted air. Similarly, phosphorus burns much more rapidly in an atmosphere of pure oxygen than in air, which is only about 20% oxygen. Figure 12.7 Statues made from carbonate compounds such as limestone and marble typically weather slowly over time due to the actions of water, and thermal expansion and contraction. However, pollutants like sulfur dioxide can accelerate weathering. As the concentration of air pollutants increases, deterioration of limestone occurs more rapidly. (credit: James P Fisher III) Link to Learning Phosphorous burns rapidly in air, but it will burn even more rapidly if the concentration of oxygen in is higher. Watch this video (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/16phosphor) to see an example. The Presence of a Catalyst Hydrogen peroxide solutions foam when poured onto an open wound because substances in the exposed tissues act as catalysts, increasing the rate of hydrogen peroxide’s decomposition. However, in the absence of these catalysts (for example, in the bottle in the medicine cabinet) complete decomposition can take months. A catalyst is a substance that increases the rate of a chemical reaction by lowering the activation energy without itself being consumed by the reaction. Activation energy is the minimum amount of energy required for a chemical reaction to proceed in the forward direction. A catalyst increases the reaction rate by providing an alternative pathway or mechanism for the

Figure 12.8 The presence of a catalyst increases the rate of a reaction by lowering its activation energy. Link to Learning Chemical reactions occur when molecules collide with each other and undergo a chemical transformation. Before physically performing a reaction in a laboratory, scientists can use molecular modeling simulations to predict how the parameters discussed earlier will influence the rate of a reaction. Use the PhET Reactions & Rates interactive (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/16PHETreaction) to explore how temperature, concentration, and the nature of the reactants affect reaction rates. 12.3 Rate Laws By the end of this section, you will be able to: Explain the form and function of a rate law • Use rate laws to calculate reaction rates • Use rate and concentration data to identify reaction orders and derive rate laws • As described in the previous module, the rate of a reaction is affected by the concentrations of reactants. Rate laws or rate equations are mathematical expressions that describe the relationship between the rate of a chemical reaction and the concentration of its reactants. In general, a rate law (or differential rate law, as it is sometimes called) takes this form: k[A]m[B]n[C] p… rate = https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

Chapter 12 | Kinetics 671 in which [A], [B], and [C] represent the molar concentrations of reactants, and k is the rate constant, which is specific for a particular reaction at a particular temperature. The exponents m, n, and p are usually positive integers (although it is possible for them to be fractions or negative numbers). The rate constant k and the exponents m, n, and p must be determined experimentally by observing how the rate of a reaction changes as the concentrations of the reactants are changed. The rate constant k is independent of the concentration of A, B, or C, but it does vary with temperature and surface area. The exponents in a rate law describe the effects of the reactant concentrations on the reaction rate and define the reaction order. Consider a reaction for which the rate law is: k[A]m[B]n rate = If the exponent m is 1, the reaction is first order with respect to A. If m is 2, the reaction is second order with respect to A. If n is 1, the reaction is first order in B. If n is 2, the reaction is second order in B. If m or n is zero, the reaction is zero order in A or B, respectively, and the rate of the reaction is not affected by the concentration of that reactant. The overall reaction order is the sum of the orders with respect to each reactant. If m = 1 and n = 1, the overall order of the reaction is second order (m + n = 1 + 1 = 2). The rate law: ⎡ ⎤ rate = k ⎣H2 O2 ⎦ describes a reaction that is first order in hydrogen peroxide and first order overall. The rate law: k⎡ ⎤ ⎦2 rate = ⎣C4 H6 describes a reaction that is second order in C4H6 and second order overall. The rate law: k[H+][OH−] rate = H+, OH−, describes a reaction that is first order in first order in and second order overall. Example 12.3 Writing Rate Laws from Reaction Orders An experiment shows that the reaction of nitrogen dioxide with carbon monoxide: NO2(g) + CO(g) ⟶NO(g) + CO2(g) is second order in NO2 and zero order in CO at 100 °C. What is the rate law for the reaction? Solution The reaction will have the form: k[NO2]m[CO]n rate = The reaction is second order in NO2; thus m = 2. The reaction is zero order in CO; thus n = 0. The rate law is: ]2[CO]0 k[NO2]2 rate = k[NO2 = [CO]0 Remember that a number raised to the zero power is equal to 1, thus = 1, which is why we can simply drop the concentration of CO from the rate equation: the rate of reaction is solely dependent on the concentration of NO2. When we consider rate mechanisms later in this chapter, we will explain how a reactant’s concentration can have no effect on a reaction despite being involved in the reaction. Check Your Learning

Answer: order in CH3OH = 1; order in CH3CH2OCOCH3 = 0; overall order = 1 It is sometimes helpful to use a more explicit algebraic method, often referred to as the method of initial rates, to determine the orders in rate laws. To use this method, we select two sets of rate data that differ in the concentration of only one reactant and set up a ratio of the two rates and the two rate laws. After canceling terms that are equal, we are left with an equation that contains only one unknown, the coefficient of the concentration that varies. We then solve this equation for the coefficient.

We can also determine a second form of each rate law that relates the concentrations of reactants and time. These are called integrated rate laws. We can use an integrated rate law to determine the amount of reactant or product present after a period of time or to estimate the time required for a reaction to proceed to a certain extent. For example, an integrated rate law is used to determine the length of time a radioactive material must be stored for its radioactivity to decay to a safe level. Using calculus, the differential rate law for a chemical reaction can be integrated with respect to time to give an equation that relates the amount of reactant or product present in a reaction mixture to the elapsed time of the reaction. This process can either be very straightforward or very complex, depending on the complexity of the differential rate law. For purposes of discussion, we will focus on the resulting integrated rate laws for first-, second-, and zero-order reactions. First-Order Reactions An equation relating the rate constant k to the initial concentration [A]0 and the concentration [A]t present after any given time t can be derived for a first-order reaction and shown to be: ln⎛ ⎞ [A]t ⎝ ⎠= −kt [A]0 or ln⎛ ⎞ [A]0 ⎝ ⎠= kt [A]t Example 12.6 https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

Solution We use the integrated form of the rate law to answer questions regarding time: ln⎛ ⎞ [A]0 ⎝ ⎠= kt [A] There are four variables in the rate law, so if we know three of them, we can determine the fourth. In this case we know [A]0, [A], and k, and need to find t.

How many days will it take for 90% of the iodine−131 in a 0.500 M solution of this substance to decay to Xe-131? Answer: 16.7 days We can use integrated rate laws with experimental data that consist of time and concentration information to determine the order and rate constant of a reaction. The integrated rate law can be rearranged to a standard linear equation format: ln[A] ln[A]0 = (−k)(t) + y = mx + b A plot of ln[A] versus t for a first-order reaction is a straight line with a slope of −k and an intercept of ln[A]0. If a set of rate data are plotted in this fashion but do not result in a straight line, the reaction is not first order in A. Example 12.7 Determination of Reaction Order by Graphing

686 Chapter 12 | Kinetics The Half-Life of a Reaction The half-life of a reaction (t1/2) is the time required for one-half of a given amount of reactant to be consumed. In each succeeding half-life, half of the remaining concentration of the reactant is consumed. Using the decomposition (Figure 12.2) of hydrogen peroxide as an example, we find that during the first half-life (from 0.00 hours to 6.00 hours), the concentration of H2O2 decreases from 1.000 M to 0.500 M. During the second half-life (from 6.00 hours to 12.00 hours), it decreases from 0.500 M to 0.250 M; during the third half-life, it decreases from 0.250 M to 0.125 M. The concentration of H2O2 decreases by half during each successive period of 6.00 hours. The decomposition of hydrogen peroxide is a first-order reaction, and, as can be shown, the half-life of a first-order reaction is independent of the concentration of the reactant. However, half-lives of reactions with other orders depend on the concentrations of the reactants. First-Order Reactions We can derive an equation for determining the half-life of a first-order reaction from the alternate form of the integrated rate law as follows: [A]0 ln = kt [A] [A]0 1 × t = ln [A] k t1/2, If we set the time t equal to the half-life, the corresponding concentration of A at this time is equal to one-half 1 t = t1/2, [A] = 2[A]0. of its initial concentration. Hence, when Therefore: [A]0 1 t1/2 = ln × k 1 2[A]0 1 1 = ln 2 × = 0.693 × k k Thus: 0.693 t1/2 = k We can see that the half-life of a first-order reaction is inversely proportional to the rate constant k. A fast reaction (shorter half-life) will have a larger k; a slow reaction (longer half-life) will have a smaller k.

Consequently, we find the use of the half-life concept to be more complex for second-order reactions than for first-order reactions. Unlike with first- order reactions, the rate constant of a second-order reaction cannot be calculated directly from the half-life unless the initial concentration is known. Zero-Order Reactions We can derive an equation for calculating the half-life of a zero order reaction as follows: [A] [A]0 = −kt + [A]0 t = t1/2 [A] = .

Atoms must be close together to form chemical bonds. This simple premise is the basis for a very powerful theory that explains many observations regarding chemical kinetics, including factors affecting reaction rates. Collision theory is based on the following postulates: The rate of a reaction is proportional to the rate of reactant collisions: 1. # collisions reaction rate ∝ time The reacting species must collide in an orientation that allows contact between the atoms that will become 2. bonded together in the product. The collision must occur with adequate energy to permit mutual penetration of the reacting species’ valence 3. shells so that the electrons can rearrange and form new bonds (and new chemical species). We can see the importance of the two physical factors noted in postulates 2 and 3, the orientation and energy of collisions, when we consider the reaction of carbon monoxide with oxygen: 2 CO(g) + O2(g) ⟶2 CO2(g) Carbon monoxide is a pollutant produced by the combustion of hydrocarbon fuels. To reduce this pollutant, automobiles have catalytic converters that use a catalyst to carry out this reaction. It is also a side reaction of the combustion of gunpowder that results in muzzle flash for many firearms. If carbon monoxide and oxygen are present in sufficient quantity, the reaction is spontaneous at high temperature and pressure. The first step in the gas-phase reaction between carbon monoxide and oxygen is a collision between the two molecules: CO(g) + O2(g) ⟶CO2(g) + O(g) Although there are many different possible orientations the two molecules can have relative to each other, consider Figure 12.14. the two presented in In the first case, the oxygen side of the carbon monoxide molecule collides with the oxygen molecule. In the second case, the carbon side of the carbon monoxide molecule collides with the oxygen molecule. The second case is clearly more likely to result in the formation of carbon dioxide, which has a

690 Chapter 12 | Kinetics (O = C = O). central carbon atom bonded to two oxygen atoms This is a rather simple example of how important the orientation of the collision is in terms of creating the desired product of the reaction. Figure 12.14 Illustrated are two collisions that might take place between carbon monoxide and oxygen molecules. The orientation of the colliding molecules partially determines whether a reaction between the two molecules will occur. If the collision does take place with the correct orientation, there is still no guarantee that the reaction will proceed to form carbon dioxide. Every reaction requires a certain amount of activation energy for it to proceed in the forward Figure 12.15 direction, yielding an appropriate activated complex along the way. As demonstrates, even a collision with the correct orientation can fail to form the reaction product. In the study of reaction mechanisms, each of these three arrangements of atoms is called a proposed activated complex or transition state. Figure 12.15 Possible transition states (activated complexes) for carbon monoxide reacting with oxygen to form carbon dioxide. Solid lines represent covalent bonds, while dotted lines represent unstable orbital overlaps that may, or may not, become covalent bonds as product is formed. In the first two examples in this figure, the O=O double bond is not impacted; therefore, carbon dioxide cannot form. The third proposed transition state will result in the formation of carbon dioxide if the third “extra” oxygen atom separates from the rest of the molecule. In most circumstances, it is impossible to isolate or identify a transition state or activated complex. In the reaction between carbon monoxide and oxygen to form carbon dioxide, activated complexes have only been observed spectroscopically in systems that utilize a heterogeneous catalyst. The gas-phase reaction occurs too rapidly to isolate any such chemical compound. Collision theory explains why most reaction rates increase as concentrations increase. With an increase in the concentration of any reacting substance, the chances for collisions between molecules are increased because there are more molecules per unit of volume. More collisions mean a faster reaction rate, assuming the energy of the collisions is adequate. Activation Energy and the Arrhenius Equation The minimum energy necessary to form a product during a collision between reactants is called the activation energy (Ea). The kinetic energy of reactant molecules plays an important role in a reaction because the energy necessary to form a product is provided by a collision of a reactant molecule with another reactant molecule. (In single-reactant reactions, activation energy may be provided by a collision of the reactant molecule with the wall of the reaction vessel or with molecules of an inert contaminant.) If the activation energy is much larger than the average kinetic https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

Chapter 12 | Kinetics 691 energy of the molecules, the reaction will occur slowly: Only a few fast-moving molecules will have enough energy to react. If the activation energy is much smaller than the average kinetic energy of the molecules, the fraction of molecules possessing the necessary kinetic energy will be large; most collisions between molecules will result in reaction, and the reaction will occur rapidly. Figure 12.16 shows the energy relationships for the general reaction of a molecule of A with a molecule of B to form molecules of C and D: A + B ⟶C + D The figure shows that the energy of the transition state is higher than that of the reactants A and B by an amount equal to Ea, the activation energy. Thus, the sum of the kinetic energies of A and B must be equal to or greater than Ea to reach the transition state. After the transition state has been reached, and as C and D begin to form, the system loses energy until its total energy is lower than that of the initial mixture. This lost energy is transferred to other molecules, giving them enough energy to reach the transition state. The forward reaction (that between molecules A and B) Figure 12.16, therefore tends to take place readily once the reaction has started. In ΔH represents the difference in enthalpy between the reactants (A and B) and the products (C and D). The sum of Ea and ΔH represents the activation energy for the reverse reaction: C + D ⟶A + B A + B ⟶C + D. Figure 12.16 This graph shows the potential energy relationships for the reaction The dashed portion of the curve represents the energy of the system with a molecule of A and a molecule of B present, and the solid portion the energy of the system with a molecule of C and a molecule of D present. The activation energy for the forward reaction is represented by Ea. The activation energy for the reverse reaction is greater than that for the forward reaction by an amount equal to ΔH. The curve’s peak is represented the transition state. We can use the Arrhenius equation to relate the activation energy and the rate constant, k, of a given reaction: Ae−Ea /RT k = In this equation, R is the ideal gas constant, which has a value 8.314 J/mol/K, T is temperature on the Kelvin scale, Ea is the activation energy in joules per mole, e is the constant 2.7183, and A is a constant called the frequency factor, which is related to the frequency of collisions and the orientation of the reacting molecules. Both postulates of the collision theory of reaction rates are accommodated in the Arrhenius equation. The frequency e−Ea /RT, factor A is related to the rate at which collisions having the correct orientation occur. The exponential term, is related to the fraction of collisions providing adequate energy to overcome the activation barrier of the reaction. 

--- Page 700 ---
692 Chapter 12 | Kinetics At one extreme, the system does not contain enough energy for collisions to overcome the activation barrier. In such cases, no reaction occurs. At the other extreme, the system has so much energy that every collision with the correct orientation can overcome the activation barrier, causing the reaction to proceed. In such cases, the reaction is nearly instantaneous. The Arrhenius equation describes quantitatively much of what we have already discussed about reaction rates. For two reactions at the same temperature, the reaction with the higher activation energy has the lower rate constant e−Ea /RT, and the slower rate. The larger value of Ea results in a smaller value for reflecting the smaller fraction of molecules with enough energy to react. Alternatively, the reaction with the smaller Ea has a larger fraction of e−Ea /RT, molecules with enough energy to react. This will be reflected as a larger value of a larger rate constant, and a faster rate for the reaction. An increase in temperature has the same effect as a decrease in activation energy. A (Figure 12.17), larger fraction of molecules has the necessary energy to react as indicated by an increase in the value e−Ea /RT. of The rate constant is also directly proportional to the frequency factor, A. Hence a change in conditions or reactants that increases the number of collisions with a favorable orientation for reaction results in an increase in A and, consequently, an increase in k. Figure 12.17 (a) As the activation energy of a reaction decreases, the number of molecules with at least this much energy increases, as shown by the shaded areas. (b) At a higher temperature, T2, more molecules have kinetic energies greater than Ea, as shown by the yellow shaded area. A convenient approach to determining Ea for a reaction involves the measurement of k at different temperatures and using of an alternate version of the Arrhenius equation that takes the form of linear equation: ⎛ ⎞ ⎛ ⎞ −Ea ⎝1 ⎝ ⎠ ln k = ⎠+ ln A R T y = mx + b −Ea 1 , Thus, a plot of ln k versus gives a straight line with the slope from which Ea may be determined. The T R intercept gives the value of ln A. Example 12.11 Determination of Ea The variation of the rate constant with temperature for the decomposition of HI(g) to H2(g) and I2(g) is given here.

The reaction mechanism (or reaction path) is the process, or pathway, by which a reaction occurs.

696 Chapter 12 | Kinetics A chemical reaction usually occurs in steps, although it may not always be obvious to an observer. The decomposition of ozone, for example, appears to follow a mechanism with two steps: O3(g) ⟶O2(g) + O O + O3(g) ⟶2O2(g) We call each step in a reaction mechanism an elementary reaction. Elementary reactions occur exactly as they are written and cannot be broken down into simpler steps. Elementary reactions add up to the overall reaction, which, for the decomposition, is: 2O3(g) ⟶3O2(g) Notice that the oxygen atom produced in the first step of this mechanism is consumed in the second step and therefore does not appear as a product in the overall reaction. Species that are produced in one step and consumed in a subsequent step are called intermediates. While the overall reaction equation for the decomposition of ozone indicates that two molecules of ozone react to give three molecules of oxygen, the mechanism of the reaction does not involve the collision and reaction of two ozone molecules. Rather, it involves a molecule of ozone decomposing to an oxygen molecule and an intermediate oxygen atom; the oxygen atom then reacts with a second ozone molecule to give two oxygen molecules. These two elementary reactions occur exactly as they are shown in the reaction mechanism. Unimolecular Elementary Reactions The molecularity of an elementary reaction is the number of reactant species (atoms, molecules, or ions). For example, a unimolecular reaction involves the rearrangement of a single reactant species to produce one or more molecules of product: A ⟶products The rate equation for a unimolecular reaction is: rate = k[A] A unimolecular reaction may be one of several elementary reactions in a complex mechanism. For example, the reaction: O3 ⟶O2 + O illustrates a unimolecular elementary reaction that occurs as one part of a two-step reaction mechanism. However, some unimolecular reactions may have only a single reaction in the reaction mechanism. (In other words, an elementary reaction can also be an overall reaction in some cases.) For example, the gas-phase decomposition of cyclobutane, C4H8, to ethylene, C2H4, occurs via a unimolecular, single-step mechanism: For these unimolecular reactions to occur, all that is required is the separation of parts of single reactant molecules into products. Chemical bonds do not simply fall apart during chemical reactions. Energy is required to break chemical bonds. The activation energy for the decomposition of C4H8, for example, is 261 kJ per mole. This means that it requires 261 kilojoules to distort one mole of these molecules into activated complexes that decompose into products: https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at 

--- Page 705 ---
Chapter 12 | Kinetics 697 In a sample of C4H8, a few of the rapidly moving C4H8 molecules collide with other rapidly moving molecules and pick up additional energy. When the C4H8 molecules gain enough energy, they can transform into an activated complex, and the formation of ethylene molecules can occur. In effect, a particularly energetic collision knocks a C4H8 molecule into the geometry of the activated complex. However, only a small fraction of gas molecules travel at sufficiently high speeds with large enough kinetic energies to accomplish this. Hence, at any given moment, only a few molecules pick up enough energy from collisions to react. The rate of decomposition of C4H8 is directly proportional to its concentration. Doubling the concentration of C4H8 in a sample gives twice as many molecules per liter. Although the fraction of molecules with enough energy to react remains the same, the total number of such molecules is twice as great. Consequently, there is twice as much C4H8 per liter, and the reaction rate is twice as fast: −Δ[C4 H8] rate = = k[C4 H8] Δt A similar relationship applies to any unimolecular elementary reaction; the reaction rate is directly proportional to the concentration of the reactant, and the reaction exhibits first-order behavior. The proportionality constant is the rate constant for the particular unimolecular reaction. Bimolecular Elementary Reactions The collision and combination of two molecules or atoms to form an activated complex in an elementary reaction is called a bimolecular reaction. There are two types of bimolecular elementary reactions: A + B ⟶products and 2A ⟶products For the first type, in which the two reactant molecules are different, the rate law is first-order in A and first order in B: rate = k[A][B] For the second type, in which two identical molecules collide and react, the rate law is second order in A: k[A]2 rate = k[A][B] = Some chemical reactions have mechanisms that consist of a single bimolecular elementary reaction. One example is the reaction of nitrogen dioxide with carbon monoxide: NO2(g) + CO(g) ⟶NO(g) + CO2(g) Figure Another is the decomposition of two hydrogen iodide molecules to produce hydrogen, H2, and iodine, I2 12.19: 2HI(g) ⟶H2(g) + I2(g)

698 Chapter 12 | Kinetics Figure 12.19 The probable mechanism for the dissociation of two HI molecules to produce one molecule of H2 and one molecule of I2. Bimolecular elementary reactions may also be involved as steps in a multistep reaction mechanism. The reaction of atomic oxygen with ozone is one example: O(g) + O3(g) ⟶2O2(g) Termolecular Elementary Reactions An elementary termolecular reaction involves the simultaneous collision of three atoms, molecules, or ions. Termolecular elementary reactions are uncommon because the probability of three particles colliding simultaneously is less than one one-thousandth of the probability of two particles colliding. There are, however, a few established termolecular elementary reactions. The reaction of nitric oxide with oxygen appears to involve termolecular steps: 2NO + O2 ⟶2NO2 k[NO]2[O2] rate = Likewise, the reaction of nitric oxide with chlorine appears to involve termolecular steps: 2NO + Cl2 ⟶2NOCl k[NO]2[Cl2] rate = Relating Reaction Mechanisms to Rate Laws It's often the case that one step in a multistep reaction mechanism is significantly slower than the others. Because a reaction cannot proceed faster than its slowest step, this step will limit the rate at which the overall reaction occurs. Figure 12.20. The slowest step is therefore called the rate-limiting step (or rate-determining step) of the reaction https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

Chapter 12 | Kinetics 699 Figure 12.20 A cattle chute is a nonchemical example of a rate-determining step. Cattle can only be moved from one holding pen to another as quickly as one animal can make its way through the chute. (credit: Loren Kerns) As described earlier, rate laws may be derived directly from the chemical equations for elementary reactions. This is not the case, however, for ordinary chemical reactions. The balanced equations most often encountered represent the overall change for some chemical system, and very often this is the result of some multistep reaction mechanisms. In every case, we must determine the overall rate law from experimental data and deduce the mechanism from the rate law (and sometimes from other data). The reaction of NO2 and CO provides an illustrative example: NO2(g) + CO(g) ⟶CO2(g) + NO(g) For temperatures above 225 °C, the rate law has been found to be: ⎡ ⎤ ⎦[CO] rate = k ⎣NO2 The reaction is first order with respect to NO2 and first-order with respect to CO. This is consistent with a single-step bimolecular mechanism and it is possible that this is the mechanism for this reaction at high temperatures. At temperatures below 225 °C, the reaction is described by a rate law that is second order with respect to NO2: ⎡ ⎤ ⎦2 rate = k ⎣NO2 This is consistent with a mechanism that involves the following two elementary reactions, the first of which is slower and is therefore the rate-determining step: (slow) NO2(g) + NO2(g) ⟶NO3(g) + NO(g) (fast) NO3(g) + CO(g) ⟶NO2(g) + CO2(g) The rate-determining step gives a rate law showing second-order dependence on the NO2 concentration, and the sum of the two equations gives the net overall reaction. In general, when the rate-determining (slower) step is the first step in a mechanism, the rate law for the overall reaction is the same as the rate law for this step. However, when the rate-determining step is preceded by a step involving an equilibrium reaction, the rate law for the overall reaction may be more difficult to derive. An elementary reaction is at equilibrium when it proceeds in both the forward and reverse directions at equal rates. Consider the dimerization of NO to N2O2, with k1 used to represent the rate constant of the forward reaction and k-1 used to represent the rate constant of the reverse reaction: NO + NO ⇌N2 O2 rateforward = ratereverse ⎡ ⎤ k1[NO]2 = k−1 ⎣N2 O2 ⎦

Example 12.12 Deriving the Overall Rate Law Expression for a Multistep Reaction Mechanism Nitryl chloride (NO2Cl) decomposes to nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and chlorine gas (Cl2) according to the following mechanism: ⇌ClO2(g) + N2 O(g) + ClO(g) 2NO2 Cl(g) (fast, k1 represents the rate constant for the forward 1. reaction and k−1 the rate constant for the reverse reaction) N2 O(g) + ClO2(g) ⇌NO2(g) + NOCl(g) (fast, k2 for the forward reaction, k−2 for the reverse 2. reaction) NOCl + ClO ⟶NO2 + Cl2 (slow, k3 the rate constant for the forward reaction) 3. Determine the overall reaction, write the rate law expression for each elementary reaction, identify any intermediates, and determine the overall rate law expression. Solution For the overall reaction, simply sum the three steps, cancel intermediates, and combine like formulas: 2NO2 Cl(g) ⟶2NO2(g) + Cl2(g) Next, write the rate law expression for each elementary reaction. Remember that for elementary reactions that are part of a mechanism, the rate law expression can be derived directly from the stoichiometry: ⎡ ⎤ ⎡ ⎤ ⎡ ⎤ ⎦[ClO] k1 ⎣NO2 Cl = k−1 ⎣ClO2 ⎣N2 O ⎦2 ⎦ ⎡ ⎤ ⎡ ⎤ ⎡ ⎤ ⎦[NOCl] k2 ⎣N2 O ⎣ClO2 ⎦= k−2 ⎣NO2 ⎦ Rate = k3[NOCl][ClO] The third step, which is the slow step, is the rate-determining step. Therefore, the overall rate law expression could be written as Rate = k3 [NOCl][ClO]. However, both NOCl and ClO are intermediates. Algebraic expressions must be used to represent [NOCl] and [ClO] such that no intermediates remain in the overall rate law expression. ⎡ ⎤ ⎦2 k1 ⎣NO2 Cl [ClO] = ⎦. Using elementary reaction 1, ⎡ ⎤ ⎡ ⎤ k−1 ⎣ClO2 ⎣N2 O ⎦ ⎡ ⎤ ⎡ ⎤ k2 ⎣N2 O ⎣ClO2 ⎦ ⎦ [NOCl] = .

A catalyst speeds up the rate of a reaction by lowering the activation energy; in addition, the catalyst is regenerated in the process. Several reactions that are thermodynamically favorable in the absence of a catalyst only occur at a reasonable rate when a catalyst is present. One such reaction is catalytic hydrogenation, the process by which hydrogen is added across an alkene C=C bond to afford the saturated alkane product. A comparison of the reaction coordinate diagrams (also known as energy Figure 12.21. diagrams) for catalyzed and uncatalyzed alkene hydrogenation is shown in 

--- Page 710 ---
702 Chapter 12 | Kinetics Figure 12.21 This graph compares the reaction coordinates for catalyzed and uncatalyzed alkene hydrogenation. Catalysts function by providing an alternate reaction mechanism that has a lower activation energy than would be found in the absence of the catalyst. In some cases, the catalyzed mechanism may include additional steps, as depicted Figure 12.22. in the reaction diagrams shown in This lower activation energy results in an increase in rate as described by the Arrhenius equation. Note that a catalyst decreases the activation energy for both the forward and the reverse reactions and hence accelerates both the forward and the reverse reactions. Consequently, the presence of a catalyst will permit a system to reach equilibrium more quickly, but it has no effect on the position of the equilibrium as reflected in the value of its equilibrium constant (see the later chapter on chemical equilibrium). Figure 12.22 This potential energy diagram shows the effect of a catalyst on the activation energy. The catalyst provides a different reaction path with a lower activation energy. As shown, the catalyzed pathway involves a two-step mechanism (note the presence of two transition states) and an intermediate species (represented by the valley between the two transitions states). https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

Chapter 12 | Kinetics 703 Example 12.13 Using Reaction Diagrams to Compare Catalyzed Reactions The two reaction diagrams here represent the same reaction: one without a catalyst and one with a catalyst. Identify which diagram suggests the presence of a catalyst, and determine the activation energy for the catalyzed reaction: Solution A catalyst does not affect the energy of reactant or product, so those aspects of the diagrams can be ignored; they are, as we would expect, identical in that respect. There is, however, a noticeable difference in the transition state, which is distinctly lower in diagram (b) than it is in (a). This indicates the use of a catalyst in diagram (b). The activation energy is the difference between the energy of the starting reagents and the transition state—a maximum on the reaction coordinate diagram. The reagents are at 6 kJ and the transition state is at 20 kJ, so the activation energy can be calculated as follows: Ea = 20 kJ −6 kJ = 14 kJ Check Your Learning Determine which of the two diagrams here (both for the same reaction) involves a catalyst, and identify the activation energy for the catalyzed reaction: Answer: Diagram (b) is a catalyzed reaction with an activation energy of about 70 kJ. Homogeneous Catalysts A homogeneous catalyst is present in the same phase as the reactants. It interacts with a reactant to form an intermediate substance, which then decomposes or reacts with another reactant in one or more steps to regenerate the original catalyst and form product. 

--- Page 712 ---
704 Chapter 12 | Kinetics As an important illustration of homogeneous catalysis, consider the earth’s ozone layer. Ozone in the upper atmosphere, which protects the earth from ultraviolet radiation, is formed when oxygen molecules absorb ultraviolet light and undergo the reaction: ⎯⎯⎯⎯hv 3O2(g) 2O3(g) → Ozone is a relatively unstable molecule that decomposes to yield diatomic oxygen by the reverse of this equation. This decomposition reaction is consistent with the following mechanism: O3 ⟶O2 + O ⟶2O2 O + O3 The presence of nitric oxide, NO, influences the rate of decomposition of ozone. Nitric oxide acts as a catalyst in the following mechanism: NO(g) + O3(g) ⟶NO2(g) + O2(g) O3(g) ⟶O2(g) + O(g) NO2(g) + O(g) ⟶NO(g) + O2(g) The overall chemical change for the catalyzed mechanism is the same as: 2O3(g) ⟶3O2(g) The nitric oxide reacts and is regenerated in these reactions. It is not permanently used up; thus, it acts as a catalyst. The rate of decomposition of ozone is greater in the presence of nitric oxide because of the catalytic activity of NO. Certain compounds that contain chlorine also catalyze the decomposition of ozone. Portrait of a Chemist Mario J. Molina The 1995 Nobel Prize in Chemistry was shared by Paul J. Crutzen, Mario J. Molina (Figure 12.23), and F. Sherwood Rowland “for their work in atmospheric chemistry, particularly concerning the formation and ozone.”[1] decomposition of Molina, a Mexican citizen, carried out the majority of his work at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). 1. “The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 1995,” Nobel Prize.org, accessed February 18, 2015, http://www.nobelprize.org/ nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1995/. https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

(credit a: courtesy of Mario Molina; credit b: modification of work by NASA) In 1974, Molina and Rowland published a paper in the journal Nature (one of the major peer-reviewed publications in the field of science) detailing the threat of chlorofluorocarbon gases to the stability of the ozone layer in earth’s upper atmosphere. The ozone layer protects earth from solar radiation by absorbing ultraviolet light. As chemical reactions deplete the amount of ozone in the upper atmosphere, a measurable “hole” forms above Antarctica, and an increase in the amount of solar ultraviolet radiation— strongly linked to the prevalence of skin cancers—reaches earth’s surface. The work of Molina and Rowland was instrumental in the adoption of the Montreal Protocol, an international treaty signed in 1987 that successfully began phasing out production of chemicals linked to ozone destruction. Molina and Rowland demonstrated that chlorine atoms from human-made chemicals can catalyze ozone destruction in a process similar to that by which NO accelerates the depletion of ozone. Chlorine atoms are generated when chlorocarbons or chlorofluorocarbons—once widely used as refrigerants and propellants—are photochemically decomposed by ultraviolet light or react with hydroxyl radicals. A sample mechanism is shown here using methyl chloride: CH3 Cl + OH ⟶Cl + other products Chlorine radicals break down ozone and are regenerated by the following catalytic cycle: Cl + O3 ⟶ClO + O2 ClO + O ⟶Cl + O2 overall Reaction: O3 + O ⟶2O2 A single monatomic chlorine can break down thousands of ozone molecules. Luckily, the majority of atmospheric chlorine exists as the catalytically inactive forms Cl2 and ClONO2. Since receiving his portion of the Nobel Prize, Molina has continued his work in atmospheric chemistry at MIT. How Sciences Interconnect

706 Chapter 12 | Kinetics Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase Deficiency Enzymes in the human body act as catalysts for important chemical reactions in cellular metabolism. As such, a deficiency of a particular enzyme can translate to a life-threatening disease. G6PD (glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase) deficiency, a genetic condition that results in a shortage of the enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, is the most common enzyme deficiency in humans. This enzyme, shown in Figure 12.24, is the rate-limiting enzyme for the metabolic pathway that supplies NADPH to cells (Figure 12.25). Figure 12.24 Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase is a rate-limiting enzyme for the metabolic pathway that supplies NADPH to cells. A disruption in this pathway can lead to reduced glutathione in red blood cells; once all glutathione is consumed, enzymes and other proteins such as hemoglobin are susceptible to damage. For example, hemoglobin can be metabolized to bilirubin, which leads to jaundice, a condition that can become severe. People who suffer from G6PD deficiency must avoid certain foods and medicines containing chemicals that can trigger damage their glutathione-deficient red blood cells. Figure 12.25 In the mechanism for the pentose phosphate pathway, G6PD catalyzes the reaction that regulates NAPDH, a co-enzyme that regulates glutathione, an antioxidant that protects red blood cells and other cells from oxidative damage. Heterogeneous Catalysts A heterogeneous catalyst is a catalyst that is present in a different phase (usually a solid) than the reactants. Such catalysts generally function by furnishing an active surface upon which a reaction can occur. Gas and liquid phase reactions catalyzed by heterogeneous catalysts occur on the surface of the catalyst rather than within the gas or liquid phase. Heterogeneous catalysis has at least four steps: https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

Chapter 12 | Kinetics 707 Adsorption of the reactant onto the surface of the catalyst 1. Activation of the adsorbed reactant 2. Reaction of the adsorbed reactant 3. Diffusion of the product from the surface into the gas or liquid phase (desorption). 4. Any one of these steps may be slow and thus may serve as the rate determining step. In general, however, in the presence of the catalyst, the overall rate of the reaction is faster than it would be if the reactants were in the gas or liquid phase. Figure 12.26 illustrates the steps that chemists believe to occur in the reaction of compounds containing a carbon–carbon double bond with hydrogen on a nickel catalyst. Nickel is the catalyst used in the hydrogenation of polyunsaturated fats and oils (which contain several carbon–carbon double bonds) to produce saturated fats and oils (which contain only carbon–carbon single bonds). C2 H4 + H2 ⟶C2 H6 Figure 12.26 There are four steps in the catalysis of the reaction by nickel. (a) Hydrogen is adsorbed on the surface, breaking the H–H bonds and forming Ni–H bonds. (b) Ethylene is adsorbed on the surface, breaking the π-bond and forming Ni–C bonds. (c) Atoms diffuse across the surface and form new C–H bonds when they collide. (d) C2H6 molecules escape from the nickel surface, since they are not strongly attracted to nickel. Other significant industrial processes that involve the use of heterogeneous catalysts include the preparation of sulfuric acid, the preparation of ammonia, the oxidation of ammonia to nitric acid, and the synthesis of methanol, CH3OH. Heterogeneous catalysts are also used in the catalytic converters found on most gasoline-powered (Figure 12.27). automobiles Chemistry in Everyday Life Automobile Catalytic Converters Scientists developed catalytic converters to reduce the amount of toxic emissions produced by burning gasoline in internal combustion engines. Catalytic converters take advantage of all five factors that affect the speed of chemical reactions to ensure that exhaust emissions are as safe as possible. By utilizing a carefully selected blend of catalytically active metals, it is possible to effect complete combustion of all carbon-containing compounds to carbon dioxide while also reducing the output of nitrogen oxides. This is particularly impressive when we consider that one step involves adding more oxygen to the molecule and the other involves removing the oxygen (Figure 12.27). 

--- Page 716 ---
708 Chapter 12 | Kinetics Figure 12.27 A catalytic converter allows for the combustion of all carbon-containing compounds to carbon dioxide, while at the same time reducing the output of nitrogen oxide and other pollutants in emissions from gasoline-burning engines. Most modern, three-way catalytic converters possess a surface impregnated with a platinum-rhodium catalyst, which catalyzes the conversion nitric oxide into dinitrogen and oxygen as well as the conversion of carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons such as octane into carbon dioxide and water vapor: 2NO2(g) ⟶N2(g) + 2O2(g) 2CO(g) + O2(g) ⟶2CO2(g) 2C8 H18(g) + 25O2(g) ⟶16CO2(g) + 18H2 O(g) In order to be as efficient as possible, most catalytic converters are preheated by an electric heater. This ensures that the metals in the catalyst are fully active even before the automobile exhaust is hot enough to maintain appropriate reaction temperatures.

Classes of Enzymes and Their Functions Class Function oxidoreductases redox reactions transferases transfer of functional groups hydrolases hydrolysis reactions lyases group elimination to form double bonds isomerases isomerization ligases bond formation with ATP hydrolysis Table 12.3 Enzyme molecules possess an active site, a part of the molecule with a shape that allows it to bond to a specific substrate (a reactant molecule), forming an enzyme-substrate complex as a reaction intermediate. There are two models that attempt to explain how this active site works. The most simplistic model is referred to as the lock-and-key hypothesis, which suggests that the molecular shapes of the active site and substrate are complementary, fitting together like a key in a lock. The induced fit hypothesis, on the other hand, suggests that the enzyme molecule is flexible and changes shape to accommodate a bond with the substrate. This is not to suggest that an enzyme’s active site is completely malleable, however. Both the lock-and-key model and the induced fit model account for the fact that enzymes can only bind with specific substrates, since in general a particular enzyme only catalyzes a particular reaction (Figure 12.28). Figure 12.28 (a) According to the lock-and-key model, the shape of an enzyme’s active site is a perfect fit for the substrate. (b) According to the induced fit model, the active site is somewhat flexible, and can change shape in order to bond with the substrate.

Relations between different rate expressions for a given reaction are derived directly from the stoichiometric coefficients of the equation representing the reaction. 12.2 Factors Affecting Reaction Rates The rate of a chemical reaction is affected by several parameters. Reactions involving two phases proceed more rapidly when there is greater surface area contact. If temperature or reactant concentration is increased, the rate of a given reaction generally increases as well. A catalyst can increase the rate of a reaction by providing an alternative pathway that causes the activation energy of the reaction to decrease. 12.3 Rate Laws Rate laws provide a mathematical description of how changes in the amount of a substance affect the rate of a chemical reaction. Rate laws are determined experimentally and cannot be predicted by reaction stoichiometry. The order of reaction describes how much a change in the amount of each substance affects the overall rate, and the overall order of a reaction is the sum of the orders for each substance present in the reaction. Reaction orders are typically first order, second order, or zero order, but fractional and even negative orders are possible. 12.4 Integrated Rate Laws Differential rate laws can be determined by the method of initial rates or other methods. We measure values for the initial rates of a reaction at different concentrations of the reactants. From these measurements, we determine the order https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

Chapter 12 | Kinetics 713 of the reaction in each reactant. Integrated rate laws are determined by integration of the corresponding differential rate laws. Rate constants for those rate laws are determined from measurements of concentration at various times during a reaction. The half-life of a reaction is the time required to decrease the amount of a given reactant by one-half. The half-life of a zero-order reaction decreases as the initial concentration of the reactant in the reaction decreases. The half-life of a first-order reaction is independent of concentration, and the half-life of a second-order reaction decreases as the concentration increases. 12.5 Collision Theory Chemical reactions require collisions between reactant species. These reactant collisions must be of proper orientation and sufficient energy in order to result in product formation. Collision theory provides a simple but effective explanation for the effect of many experimental parameters on reaction rates. The Arrhenius equation describes the relation between a reaction’s rate constant and its activation energy, temperature, and dependence on collision orientation. 12.6 Reaction Mechanisms The sequence of individual steps, or elementary reactions, by which reactants are converted into products during the course of a reaction is called the reaction mechanism. The overall rate of a reaction is determined by the rate of the slowest step, called the rate-determining step. Unimolecular elementary reactions have first-order rate laws, while bimolecular elementary reactions have second-order rate laws. By comparing the rate laws derived from a reaction mechanism to that determined experimentally, the mechanism may be deemed either incorrect or plausible. 12.7 Catalysis Catalysts affect the rate of a chemical reaction by altering its mechanism to provide a lower activation energy. Catalysts can be homogenous (in the same phase as the reactants) or heterogeneous (a different phase than the reactants). Exercises 12.1 Chemical Reaction Rates 1.

722 Chapter 12 | Kinetics 61. An elevated level of the enzyme alkaline phosphatase (ALP) in the serum is an indication of possible liver or bone disorder. The level of serum ALP is so low that it is very difficult to measure directly. However, ALP catalyzes a number of reactions, and its relative concentration can be determined by measuring the rate of one of these reactions under controlled conditions. One such reaction is the conversion of p-nitrophenyl phosphate (PNPP) to p- nitrophenoxide ion (PNP) and phosphate ion. Control of temperature during the test is very important; the rate of the reaction increases 1.47 times if the temperature changes from 30 °C to 37 °C. What is the activation energy for the ALP–catalyzed conversion of PNPP to PNP and phosphate? 62.

Chapter Outline 13.1 Chemical Equilibria 13.2 Equilibrium Constants 13.3 Shifting Equilibria: Le Châtelier’s Principle 13.4 Equilibrium Calculations Introduction Imagine a beach populated with sunbathers and swimmers. As those basking in the sun get too hot and want to cool off, they head into the surf to swim. As the swimmers tire, they head to the beach to rest. If these two rates of transfer (sunbathers entering the water, swimmers leaving the water) are equal, the number of sunbathers and swimmers would be constant, or at equilibrium, although the identities of the people are constantly changing from sunbather to swimmer and back. An analogous situation occurs in chemical reactions. Reactions can occur in both directions simultaneously (reactants to products and products to reactants) and eventually reach a state of balance. These balanced two-way reactions occur all around and even in us. For example, they occur in our blood, where −) (HCO3 (Figure 13.1). the reaction between carbon dioxide and water forms carbonic acid Human physiology ⎛ −and H+). ⎝HCO3 is adapted to the amount of ionized products produced by this reaction In this chapter, you will learn how to predict the position of the balance and the yield of a product of a reaction under specific conditions, how to change a reaction's conditions to increase or reduce yield, and how to evaluate an equilibrium system's reaction to disturbances.

730 Chapter 13 | Fundamental Equilibrium Concepts 13.1 Chemical Equilibria By the end of this section, you will be able to: Describe the nature of equilibrium systems • Explain the dynamic nature of a chemical equilibrium • A chemical reaction is usually written in a way that suggests it proceeds in one direction, the direction in which we read, but all chemical reactions are reversible, and both the forward and reverse reaction occur to one degree or another depending on conditions. In a chemical equilibrium, the forward and reverse reactions occur at equal rates, and the concentrations of products and reactants remain constant. If we run a reaction in a closed system so that the products cannot escape, we often find the reaction does not give a 100% yield of products. Instead, some reactants remain after the concentrations stop changing. At this point, when there is no further change in concentrations of reactants and products, we say the reaction is at equilibrium. A mixture of reactants and products is found at equilibrium. For example, when we place a sample of dinitrogen tetroxide (N2O4, a colorless gas) in a glass tube, it forms nitrogen dioxide (NO2, a brown gas) by the reaction N2 O4(g) ⇌2NO2(g) The color becomes darker as N2O4 is converted to NO2. When the system reaches equilibrium, both N2O4 and NO2 (Figure 13.2). are present https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at 

--- Page 739 ---
Chapter 13 | Fundamental Equilibrium Concepts 731 Figure 13.2 A mixture of NO2 and N2O4 moves toward equilibrium. Colorless N2O4 reacts to form brown NO2. As the reaction proceeds toward equilibrium, the color of the mixture darkens due to the increasing concentration of NO2. (⇌) The formation of NO2 from N2O4 is a reversible reaction, which is identified by the equilibrium arrow . All reactions are reversible, but many reactions, for all practical purposes, proceed in one direction until the reactants are exhausted and will reverse only under certain conditions. Such reactions are often depicted with a one-way arrow from reactants to products. Many other reactions, such as the formation of NO2 from N2O4, are reversible under more easily obtainable conditions and, therefore, are named as such. In a reversible reaction, the reactants can combine to form products and the products can react to form the reactants. Thus, not only can N2O4 decompose to form NO2, but the NO2 produced can react to form N2O4. As soon as the forward reaction produces any NO2, the reverse reaction begins and NO2 starts to react to form N2O4. At equilibrium, the concentrations of N2O4 and NO2 no longer change because the rate of formation of NO2 is exactly equal to the rate of consumption of NO2, and the rate of formation of N2O4 is exactly equal to the rate of consumption of N2O4. Chemical equilibrium is a dynamic process: As with the swimmers and the sunbathers, the numbers of each remain constant, yet there is a flux back and forth between them (Figure 13.3).

732 Chapter 13 | Fundamental Equilibrium Concepts Figure 13.3 These jugglers provide an illustration of dynamic equilibrium. Each throws clubs to the other at the same rate at which he receives clubs from that person. Because clubs are thrown continuously in both directions, the number of clubs moving in each direction is constant, and the number of clubs each juggler has at a given time remains (roughly) constant. In a chemical equilibrium, the forward and reverse reactions do not stop, rather they continue to occur at the same rate, leading to constant concentrations of the reactants and the products. Plots showing how the reaction rates and Figure 13.2. concentrations change with respect to time are shown in We can detect a state of equilibrium because the concentrations of reactants and products do not appear to change. However, it is important that we verify that the absence of change is due to equilibrium and not to a reaction rate that is so slow that changes in concentration are difficult to detect. We use a double arrow when writing an equation for a reversible reaction. Such a reaction may or may not be at Figure 13.2 equilibrium. For example, shows the reaction: N2 O4(g) ⇌2NO2(g) When we wish to speak about one particular component of a reversible reaction, we use a single arrow. For example, Figure 13.2, in the equilibrium shown in the rate of the forward reaction 2NO2(g) ⟶N2 O4(g) is equal to the rate of the backward reaction N2 O4(g) ⟶2NO2(g) Chemistry in Everyday Life Equilibrium and Soft Drinks The connection between chemistry and carbonated soft drinks goes back to 1767, when Joseph Priestley (1733–1804; mostly known today for his role in the discovery and identification of oxygen) discovered a method of infusing water with carbon dioxide to make carbonated water. In 1772, Priestly published a paper entitled “Impregnating Water with Fixed Air.” The paper describes dripping oil of vitriol (today we call this sulfuric acid, but what a great way to describe sulfuric acid: “oil of vitriol” literally means “liquid nastiness”) onto chalk (calcium carbonate). The resulting CO2 falls into the container of water beneath the vessel in which the initial reaction takes place; agitation helps the gaseous CO2 mix into the liquid water. https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

Chapter 13 | Fundamental Equilibrium Concepts 733 H2 SO4(l) ⟶CO2(g) + H2 O(l) + CaSO4(aq) + CaCO3(s) Carbon dioxide is slightly soluble in water. There is an equilibrium reaction that occurs as the carbon dioxide reacts with the water to form carbonic acid (H2CO3). Since carbonic acid is a weak acid, it can dissociate into −). (H+) (HCO3 protons and hydrogen carbonate ions −(aq) H+(aq) CO2(aq) + H2 O(l) ⇌H2 CO3(aq) ⇌HCO3 + Today, CO2 can be pressurized into soft drinks, establishing the equilibrium shown above. Once you open the beverage container, however, a cascade of equilibrium shifts occurs. First, the CO2 gas in the air space on top of the bottle escapes, causing the equilibrium between gas-phase CO2 and dissolved or aqueous CO2 to shift, lowering the concentration of CO2 in the soft drink. Less CO2 dissolved in the liquid leads to carbonic acid decomposing to dissolved CO2 and H2O. The lowered carbonic acid concentration causes a shift of the final equilibrium. As long as the soft drink is in an open container, the CO2 bubbles up out of the beverage, releasing the gas into the air (Figure 13.4). With the lid off the bottle, the CO2 reactions are no longer at equilibrium and will continue until no more of the reactants remain. This results in a soft drink with a much lowered CO2 concentration, often referred to as “flat.” Figure 13.4 When a soft drink is opened, several equilibrium shifts occur. (credit: modification of work by “D Coetzee”/Flickr) Let us consider the evaporation of bromine as a second example of a system at equilibrium. Br2(l) ⇌Br2(g) An equilibrium can be established for a physical change—like this liquid to gas transition—as well as for a chemical Figure 13.5 reaction. shows a sample of liquid bromine at equilibrium with bromine vapor in a closed container. When we pour liquid bromine into an empty bottle in which there is no bromine vapor, some liquid evaporates, the amount of liquid decreases, and the amount of vapor increases. If we cap the bottle so no vapor escapes, the amount of liquid and vapor will eventually stop changing and an equilibrium between the liquid and the vapor will be established. If the bottle were not capped, the bromine vapor would escape and no equilibrium would be reached.

A general equation for a reversible reaction may be written as follows: mA + nB + ⇌xC + yD We can write the reaction quotient (Q) for this equation. When evaluated using concentrations, it is called Qc. We use brackets to indicate molar concentrations of reactants and products. [C]x[D]y Qc = [A]m[B]n The reaction quotient is equal to the molar concentrations of the products of the chemical equation (multiplied together) over the reactants (also multiplied together), with each concentration raised to the power of the coefficient of that substance in the balanced chemical equation.

When pure reactants are mixed, Qc is initially zero because there are no products present at that point. As the reaction proceeds, the value of Qc increases as the concentrations of the products (Figure 13.6). increase and the concentrations of the reactants simultaneously decrease When the reaction reaches equilibrium, the value of the reaction quotient no longer changes because the concentrations no longer change.

(b) The change in concentrations of reactants and O2(g) 2SO3(g) ⇌2SO2(g) + products is depicted as the reaction approaches equilibrium. (c) The graph shows the change in the value of the reaction quotient as the reaction approaches equilibrium. When a mixture of reactants and products of a reaction reaches equilibrium at a given temperature, its reaction quotient always has the same value. This value is called the equilibrium constant (K) of the reaction at that temperature. As for the reaction quotient, when evaluated in terms of concentrations, it is noted as Kc. That a reaction quotient always assumes the same value at equilibrium can be expressed as: [C]x[D]y... Qc at equilibrium = Kc = [A]m[B]n... This equation is a mathematical statement of the law of mass action: When a reaction has attained equilibrium at a given temperature, the reaction quotient for the reaction always has the same value.

As will be discussed later in this module, the rigorous approach to computing equilibrium constants uses dimensionless quantities derived from concentrations instead of actual concentrations, and so Kc values are truly unitless. Check Your Learning 2SO2(g) + O2(g) ⇌2SO3(g), the concentrations at equilibrium are [SO2] = 0.90 M, [O2] For the reaction = 0.35 M, and [SO3] = 1.1 M. What is the value of the equilibrium constant, Kc? Answer: Kc = 4.3 The magnitude of an equilibrium constant is a measure of the yield of a reaction when it reaches equilibrium. A large value for Kc indicates that equilibrium is attained only after the reactants have been largely converted into products. A small value of Kc—much less than 1—indicates that equilibrium is attained when only a small proportion of the reactants have been converted into products. Once a value of Kc is known for a reaction, it can be used to predict directional shifts when compared to the value of Figure Qc. A system that is not at equilibrium will proceed in the direction that establishes equilibrium. The data in 13.7 illustrate this. When heated to a consistent temperature, 800 °C, different starting mixtures of CO, H2O, CO2, and H2 react to reach compositions adhering to the same equilibrium (the value of Qc changes until it equals the value of Kc). This value is 0.640, the equilibrium constant for the reaction under these conditions. ⇌CO2(g) + H2(g) Kc = 0.640 T = 800 °C CO(g) + H2 O(g) It is important to recognize that an equilibrium can be established starting either from reactants or from products, or Figure 13.7 from a mixture of both. For example, equilibrium was established from Mixture 2 in when the products of the reaction were heated in a closed container. In fact, one technique used to determine whether a reaction is truly at equilibrium is to approach equilibrium starting with reactants in one experiment and starting with products in another. If the same value of the reaction quotient is observed when the concentrations stop changing in both experiments, then we may be certain that the system has reached equilibrium.

It should be pointed out that using concentrations in these computations is a convenient but simplified approach that sometimes leads to results that seemingly conflict with the law of mass action. For example, equilibria involving aqueous ions often exhibit equilibrium constants that vary quite significantly (are not constant) at high solution concentrations. This may be avoided by computing Kc values using the activities of the reactants and products in the equilibrium system instead of their concentrations. The activity of a substance is a measure of its effective concentration under specified conditions. While a detailed discussion of this important quantity is beyond the scope of an introductory text, it is necessary to be aware of a few important aspects: Activities are dimensionless (unitless) quantities and are in essence “adjusted” concentrations. • For relatively dilute solutions, a substance's activity and its molar concentration are roughly equal. • Activities for pure condensed phases (solids and liquids) are equal to 1. • As a consequence of this last consideration, Qc and Kc expressions do not contain terms for solids or liquids (being numerically equal to 1, these terms have no effect on the expression's value). Several examples of equilibria yielding such expressions will be encountered in this section.

740 Chapter 13 | Fundamental Equilibrium Concepts Homogeneous Equilibria A homogeneous equilibrium is one in which all of the reactants and products are present in a single solution (by definition, a homogeneous mixture). In this chapter, we will concentrate on the two most common types of homogeneous equilibria: those occurring in liquid-phase solutions and those involving exclusively gaseous species. Reactions between solutes in liquid solutions belong to one type of homogeneous equilibria. The chemical species involved can be molecules, ions, or a mixture of both. Several examples are provided here. ⎡ ⎤ ⎣C2 H2 Br4 ⎦ Br4(aq) Kc = C2 H2(aq) + 2Br2(aq) ⇌C2 H2 ⎡ ⎤ ⎡ ⎤ ⎦2 ⎣C2 H2 ⎣Br2 ⎦ ⎡ −⎤ ⎣I3 ⎦ I−(aq) −(aq) I2(aq) + ⇌I3 Kc = [I2][I−] 2+(aq) ⇌2Hg2+(aq) −(aq) O+(aq) HNO2(aq) + 4H2 O(l) Hg2 + NO3 + 3H3 + [Hg2+]2[HNO2] Kc = 2+][NO3 O+]3 −][H3 [Hg2 O+][F−] [H3 F−(aq) O+(aq) + Kc = HF(aq) + H2 O(l) ⇌H3 [HF] +][OH−] [NH4 +(aq) OH−(aq) NH3(aq) O(l) ⇌NH4 + Kc = + H2 ⎡ ⎤ ⎣NH3 ⎦ In each of these examples, the equilibrium system is an aqueous solution, as denoted by the aq annotations on the solute formulas. Since H2O(l) is the solvent for these solutions, its concentration does not appear as a term in the Kc expression, as discussed earlier, even though it may also appear as a reactant or product in the chemical equation. Reactions in which all reactants and products are gases represent a second class of homogeneous equilibria. We use molar concentrations in the following examples, but we will see shortly that partial pressures of the gases may be used as well. ⎡ ⎤ ⎡ ⎤ ⎣C2 H4 ⎣H2 ⎦ ⎦ C2 H6(g) ⇌C2 H4(g) + H2(g) Kc = ⎤ ⎡ ⎣C2 H6 ⎦ ⎡ ⎤ ⎦2 ⎣O3 3O2(g) ⇌2O3(g) Kc = ⎡ ⎤ ⎦3 ⎣O2 ⎡ ⎤ ⎦2 ⎣NH3 N2(g) + 3H2(g) ⇌2NH3(g) Kc = ⎡ ⎤ ⎡ ⎤ ⎦3 ⎣N2 ⎣H2 ⎦ ⎡ ⎤ ⎡ ⎤ ⎦3 ⎦4 ⎣CO2 ⎣H2 O ⇌3CO2(g) + 4H2 O(g) Kc = C3 H8(g) + 5O2(g) ⎡ ⎤ ⎡ ⎤ ⎦5 ⎣C3 H8 ⎣O2 ⎦ Note that the concentration of H2O(g) has been included in the last example because water is not the solvent in this gas-phase reaction and its concentration (and activity) changes. Whenever gases are involved in a reaction, the partial pressure of each gas can be used instead of its concentration in the equation for the reaction quotient because the partial pressure of a gas is directly proportional to its concentration at constant temperature. This relationship can be derived from the ideal gas equation, where M is the molar n V. concentration of gas, PV = nRT ⎛ ⎞ ⎝n P = ⎠RT V = MRT Thus, at constant temperature, the pressure of a gas is directly proportional to its concentration. https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

Chapter 13 | Fundamental Equilibrium Concepts 741 Using the partial pressures of the gases, we can write the reaction quotient for the system C2 H6(g) ⇌C2 H4(g) + H2(g) by following the same guidelines for deriving concentration-based expressions: PC2 PH2 H4 QP = PC2 H6 PC2 In this equation we use QP to indicate a reaction quotient written with partial pressures: is the partial pressure H6 PH2, PC2 H6, of C2H6; the partial pressure of H2; and the partial pressure of C2H4. At equilibrium: PC2 PH2 H4 KP = QP = PC2 H6 The subscript P in the symbol KP designates an equilibrium constant derived using partial pressures instead of concentrations. The equilibrium constant, KP, is still a constant, but its numeric value may differ from the equilibrium constant found for the same reaction by using concentrations. Conversion between a value for Kc, an equilibrium constant expressed in terms of concentrations, and a value for KP, an equilibrium constant expressed in terms of pressures, is straightforward (a K or Q without a subscript could be either concentration or pressure). mA + nB ⇌xC + yD: The equation relating Kc and KP is derived as follows.

The phases may be any combination of solid, liquid, or gas phases, and solutions. When dealing with these equilibria, remember that solids and pure liquids do not appear in equilibrium constant expressions (the activities of pure solids, pure liquids, and solvents are 1). Some heterogeneous equilibria involve chemical changes; for example: [Pb2+][Cl−]2 ⇌Pb2+(aq) 2Cl−(aq) + Kc = PbCl2(s) 1 CaO(s) + CO2(g) ⇌CaCO3(s) Kc = [CO2] [CS2] C(s) + 2S(g) ⇌CS2(g) Kc = [S]2 Other heterogeneous equilibria involve phase changes, for example, the evaporation of liquid bromine, as shown in the following equation: Br2(l) ⇌Br2(g) Kc = [Br2] https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

We can tell a reaction is at equilibrium if the reaction quotient (Q) is equal to the equilibrium constant (K). We next address what happens when a system at equilibrium is disturbed so that Q is no longer equal to K. If a system at equilibrium is subjected to a perturbance or stress (such as a change in concentration) the position of equilibrium changes. Since this stress affects the concentrations of the reactants and the products, the value of Q will no longer equal the value of K. To re-establish equilibrium, the system will either shift toward the products (if Q < K) or the reactants (if Q > K) until Q returns to the same value as K. This process is described by Le Châtelier's principle: When a chemical system at equilibrium is disturbed, it returns to equilibrium by counteracting the disturbance. As described in the previous paragraph, the disturbance causes a change in Q; the reaction will shift to re-establish Q = K. Predicting the Direction of a Reversible Reaction Le Châtelier's principle can be used to predict changes in equilibrium concentrations when a system that is at equilibrium is subjected to a stress. However, if we have a mixture of reactants and products that have not yet reached equilibrium, the changes necessary to reach equilibrium may not be so obvious. In such a case, we can compare the values of Q and K for the system to predict the changes. Effect of Change in Concentration on Equilibrium A chemical system at equilibrium can be temporarily shifted out of equilibrium by adding or removing one or more of the reactants or products. The concentrations of both reactants and products then undergo additional changes to return the system to equilibrium. SCN−(lowering Figure 13.8 The stress on the system in is the reduction of the equilibrium concentration of the concentration of one of the reactants would cause Q to be larger than K). As a consequence, Le Châtelier's principle Fe(SCN)2+ SCN− leads us to predict that the concentration of should decrease, increasing the concentration of Fe3+ part way back to its original concentration, and increasing the concentration of above its initial equilibrium concentration.

A mixture of gases at 400 °C with [H2] = [I2] = 0.221 M and [HI] = 1.563 M is at equilibrium; for this mixture, Qc = Kc = 50.0. If H2 is introduced into the system so quickly that its concentration doubles before it begins to react (new [H2] = 0.442 M), the reaction will shift so that a new equilibrium is reached, at which [H2] = 0.374 M, [I2] = 0.153 M, and [HI] = 1.692 M. This gives: (1.692)2 [HI]2 Qc = ⎦= = 50.0 = Kc ⎡ ⎤ ⎡ ⎤ (0.374)(0.153) ⎣H2 ⎣I2 ⎦ We have stressed this system by introducing additional H2. The stress is relieved when the reaction shifts to the right, using up some (but not all) of the excess H2, reducing the amount of uncombined I2, and forming additional HI. Effect of Change in Pressure on Equilibrium Sometimes we can change the position of equilibrium by changing the pressure of a system. However, changes in pressure have a measurable effect only in systems in which gases are involved, and then only when the chemical reaction produces a change in the total number of gas molecules in the system. An easy way to recognize such a system is to look for different numbers of moles of gas on the reactant and product sides of the equilibrium. While evaluating pressure (as well as related factors like volume), it is important to remember that equilibrium constants are defined with regard to concentration (for Kc) or partial pressure (for KP). Some changes to total pressure, like adding an inert gas that is not part of the equilibrium, will change the total pressure but not the partial pressures of the gases in the equilibrium constant expression. Thus, addition of a gas not involved in the equilibrium will not perturb the equilibrium. https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

Chapter 13 | Fundamental Equilibrium Concepts 745 Link to Learning Check out this link (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/16equichange) to see a dramatic visual demonstration of how equilibrium changes with pressure changes. As we increase the pressure of a gaseous system at equilibrium, either by decreasing the volume of the system or by adding more of one of the components of the equilibrium mixture, we introduce a stress by increasing the partial pressures of one or more of the components. In accordance with Le Châtelier's principle, a shift in the equilibrium that reduces the total number of molecules per unit of volume will be favored because this relieves the stress. The reverse reaction would be favored by a decrease in pressure. Consider what happens when we increase the pressure on a system in which NO, O2, and NO2 are at equilibrium: ⇌2NO2(g) 2NO(g) + O2(g) The formation of additional amounts of NO2 decreases the total number of molecules in the system because each time two molecules of NO2 form, a total of three molecules of NO and O2 are consumed. This reduces the total pressure exerted by the system and reduces, but does not completely relieve, the stress of the increased pressure. On the other hand, a decrease in the pressure on the system favors decomposition of NO2 into NO and O2, which tends to restore the pressure. Now consider this reaction: N2(g) + O2(g) ⇌2NO(g) Because there is no change in the total number of molecules in the system during reaction, a change in pressure does not favor either formation or decomposition of gaseous nitrogen monoxide. Effect of Change in Temperature on Equilibrium Changing concentration or pressure perturbs an equilibrium because the reaction quotient is shifted away from the equilibrium value. Changing the temperature of a system at equilibrium has a different effect: A change in temperature actually changes the value of the equilibrium constant. However, we can qualitatively predict the effect of the temperature change by treating it as a stress on the system and applying Le Châtelier's principle. When hydrogen reacts with gaseous iodine, heat is evolved. (exothermic) H2(g) + I2(g) ⇌2HI(g) ΔH = −9.4 kJ Because this reaction is exothermic, we can write it with heat as a product. H2(g) + I2(g) ⇌2HI(g) + heat Increasing the temperature of the reaction increases the internal energy of the system. Thus, increasing the temperature has the effect of increasing the amount of one of the products of this reaction. The reaction shifts to the left to relieve the stress, and there is an increase in the concentration of H2 and I2 and a reduction in the concentration of HI. Lowering the temperature of this system reduces the amount of energy present, favors the production of heat, and favors the formation of hydrogen iodide. When we change the temperature of a system at equilibrium, the equilibrium constant for the reaction changes. Lowering the temperature in the HI system increases the equilibrium constant: At the new equilibrium the concentration of HI has increased and the concentrations of H2 and I2 decreased. Raising the temperature decreases the value of the equilibrium constant, from 67.5 at 357 °C to 50.0 at 400 °C. Temperature affects the equilibrium between NO2 and N2O4 in this reaction

746 Chapter 13 | Fundamental Equilibrium Concepts N2 O4(g) ⇌2NO2(g) ΔH = 57.20 kJ The positive ΔH value tells us that the reaction is endothermic and could be written heat + N2 O4(g) ⇌2NO2(g) At higher temperatures, the gas mixture has a deep brown color, indicative of a significant amount of brown NO2 molecules. If, however, we put a stress on the system by cooling the mixture (withdrawing energy), the equilibrium shifts to the left to supply some of the energy lost by cooling. The concentration of colorless N2O4 increases, and the concentration of brown NO2 decreases, causing the brown color to fade.

Catalysts Do Not Affect Equilibrium As we learned during our study of kinetics, a catalyst can speed up the rate of a reaction. Though this increase in reaction rate may cause a system to reach equilibrium more quickly (by speeding up the forward and reverse reactions), a catalyst has no effect on the value of an equilibrium constant nor on equilibrium concentrations. The interplay of changes in concentration or pressure, temperature, and the lack of an influence of a catalyst on a chemical equilibrium is illustrated in the industrial synthesis of ammonia from nitrogen and hydrogen according to the equation ⇌2NH3(g) N2(g) + 3H2(g) A large quantity of ammonia is manufactured by this reaction. Each year, ammonia is among the top 10 chemicals, by mass, manufactured in the world. About 2 billion pounds are manufactured in the United States each year. Ammonia plays a vital role in our global economy. It is used in the production of fertilizers and is, itself, an important fertilizer for the growth of corn, cotton, and other crops. Large quantities of ammonia are converted to nitric acid, which plays an important role in the production of fertilizers, explosives, plastics, dyes, and fibers, and is also used in the steel industry. Portrait of a Chemist Fritz Haber In the early 20th century, German chemist Fritz Haber (Figure 13.9) developed a practical process for converting diatomic nitrogen, which cannot be used by plants as a nutrient, to ammonia, a form of nitrogen that is easiest for plants to absorb. ⇌2NH3(g) N2(g) + 3H2(g) The availability of nitrogen is a strong limiting factor to the growth of plants. Despite accounting for 78% of air, diatomic nitrogen (N2) is nutritionally unavailable due the tremendous stability of the nitrogen-nitrogen triple bond. For plants to use atmospheric nitrogen, the nitrogen must be converted to a more bioavailable form (this conversion is called nitrogen fixation). https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

Chapter 13 | Fundamental Equilibrium Concepts 747 Haber was born in Breslau, Prussia (presently Wroclaw, Poland) in December 1868. He went on to study chemistry and, while at the University of Karlsruhe, he developed what would later be known as the Haber process: the catalytic formation of ammonia from hydrogen and atmospheric nitrogen under high temperatures and pressures. For this work, Haber was awarded the 1918 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for synthesis of ammonia from its elements. The Haber process was a boon to agriculture, as it allowed the production of fertilizers to no longer be dependent on mined feed stocks such as sodium nitrate. Currently, the annual production of synthetic nitrogen fertilizers exceeds 100 million tons and synthetic fertilizer production has increased the number of humans that arable land can support from 1.9 persons per hectare in 1908 to 4.3 in 2008. Figure 13.9 The work of Nobel Prize recipient Fritz Haber revolutionized agricultural practices in the early 20th century. His work also affected wartime strategies, adding chemical weapons to the artillery. In addition to his work in ammonia production, Haber is also remembered by history as one of the fathers of chemical warfare. During World War I, he played a major role in the development of poisonous gases used for trench warfare. Regarding his role in these developments, Haber said, “During peace time a scientist belongs country.”[1] to the World, but during war time he belongs to his Haber defended the use of gas warfare against accusations that it was inhumane, saying that death was death, by whatever means it was inflicted. He stands as an example of the ethical dilemmas that face scientists in times of war and the double-edged nature of the sword of science. Like Haber, the products made from ammonia can be multifaceted. In addition to their value for agriculture, nitrogen compounds can also be used to achieve destructive ends. Ammonium nitrate has also been used in explosives, including improvised explosive devices. Ammonium nitrate was one of the components of the bomb used in the attack on the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in downtown Oklahoma City on April 19, 1995. It has long been known that nitrogen and hydrogen react to form ammonia. However, it became possible to manufacture ammonia in useful quantities by the reaction of nitrogen and hydrogen only in the early 20th century after the factors that influence its equilibrium were understood. To be practical, an industrial process must give a large yield of product relatively quickly. One way to increase the yield of ammonia is to increase the pressure on the system in which N2, H2, and NH3 are at equilibrium or are coming to equilibrium. ⇌2NH3(g) N2(g) + 3H2(g) 1.

748 Chapter 13 | Fundamental Equilibrium Concepts The formation of additional amounts of ammonia reduces the total pressure exerted by the system and somewhat reduces the stress of the increased pressure. Although increasing the pressure of a mixture of N2, H2, and NH3 will increase the yield of ammonia, at low temperatures, the rate of formation of ammonia is slow. At room temperature, for example, the reaction is so slow that if we prepared a mixture of N2 and H2, no detectable amount of ammonia would form during our lifetime. The formation of ammonia from hydrogen and nitrogen is an exothermic process: ⟶2NH3(g) ΔH = −92.2 kJ N2(g) + 3H2(g) Thus, increasing the temperature to increase the rate lowers the yield. If we lower the temperature to shift the equilibrium to favor the formation of more ammonia, equilibrium is reached more slowly because of the large decrease of reaction rate with decreasing temperature. Part of the rate of formation lost by operating at lower temperatures can be recovered by using a catalyst. The net effect of the catalyst on the reaction is to cause equilibrium to be reached more rapidly. In the commercial production of ammonia, conditions of about 500 °C, 150–900 atm, and the presence of a catalyst are used to give the best compromise among rate, yield, and the cost of the equipment necessary to produce and (Figure 13.10). contain high-pressure gases at high temperatures Figure 13.10 Commercial production of ammonia requires heavy equipment to handle the high temperatures and pressures required.

Chapter 13 | Fundamental Equilibrium Concepts 749 13.4 Equilibrium Calculations By the end of this section, you will be able to: Write equations representing changes in concentration and pressure for chemical species in • equilibrium systems Use algebra to perform various types of equilibrium calculations • We know that at equilibrium, the value of the reaction quotient of any reaction is equal to its equilibrium constant. Thus, we can use the mathematical expression for Q to determine a number of quantities associated with a reaction at equilibrium or approaching equilibrium. While we have learned to identify in which direction a reaction will shift to reach equilibrium, we want to extend that understanding to quantitative calculations. We do so by evaluating the ways that the concentrations of products and reactants change as a reaction approaches equilibrium, keeping in mind the stoichiometric ratios of the reaction. This algebraic approach to equilibrium calculations will be explored in this section. Changes in concentrations or pressures of reactants and products occur as a reaction system approaches equilibrium. In this section we will see that we can relate these changes to each other using the coefficients in the balanced chemical equation describing the system. We use the decomposition of ammonia as an example. On heating, ammonia reversibly decomposes into nitrogen and hydrogen according to this equation: 2NH3(g) ⇌N2(g) + 3H2(g) If a sample of ammonia decomposes in a closed system and the concentration of N2 increases by 0.11 M, the change in the N2 concentration, Δ[N2], the final concentration minus the initial concentration, is 0.11 M. The change is positive because the concentration of N2 increases. The change in the H2 concentration, Δ[H2], is also positive—the concentration of H2 increases as ammonia decomposes. The chemical equation tells us that the change in the concentration of H2 is three times the change in the concentration of N2 because for each mole of N2 produced, 3 moles of H2 are produced. ⎡ ⎤ ⎡ ⎤ Δ ⎣H2 ⎦= 3 × Δ ⎣N2 ⎦ = 3 × (0.11 M) = 0.33 M The change in concentration of NH3, Δ[NH3], is twice that of Δ[N2]; the equation indicates that 2 moles of NH3 must decompose for each mole of N2 formed. However, the change in the NH3 concentration is negative because the concentration of ammonia decreases as it decomposes. Δ⎡ ⎤ ⎡ ⎤ ⎣NH3 ⎦= −2 × Δ ⎣N2 ⎦= −2 × (0.11 M) = −0.22 M We can relate these relationships directly to the coefficients in the equation 2NH3(g) ⇌ N2(g) + 3H2(g) Δ[NH3] = −2 × Δ[N2] Δ[N2] = 0.11 M Δ[H2] = 3 × Δ[N2] Note that all the changes on one side of the arrows are of the same sign and that all the changes on the other side of the arrows are of the opposite sign. If we did not know the magnitude of the change in the concentration of N2, we could represent it by the symbol x. ⎡ ⎤ Δ ⎣N2 ⎦= x The changes in the other concentrations would then be represented as: ⎡ ⎤ ⎡ ⎤ Δ ⎣H2 ⎦= 3 × Δ ⎣N2 ⎦= 3x Δ⎡ ⎤ ⎡ ⎤ ⎣NH3 ⎦= −2 × Δ ⎣N2 ⎦= −2x

750 Chapter 13 | Fundamental Equilibrium Concepts The coefficients in the Δ terms are identical to those in the balanced equation for the reaction. 2NH3(g) ⇌N2(g) + 3H2(g) −2x x 3x The simplest way for us to find the coefficients for the concentration changes in any reaction is to use the coefficients in the balanced chemical equation.

It may help if we keep in mind that Qc = Kc (at equilibrium) in all of these situations and that there are only three basic types of calculations: Calculation of an equilibrium constant.

Calculation of equilibrium concentrations from initial concentrations. If the value of the equilibrium 3. constant and a set of concentrations of reactants and products that are not at equilibrium are known, the concentrations at equilibrium can be calculated. A similar list could be generated using QP, KP, and partial pressure. We will look at solving each of these cases in sequence. Calculation of an Equilibrium Constant Since the law of mass action is the only equation we have to describe the relationship between Kc and the concentrations of reactants and products, any problem that requires us to solve for Kc must provide enough information to determine the reactant and product concentrations at equilibrium. Armed with the concentrations, we can solve the equation for Kc, as it will be the only unknown. Example 13.6 showed us how to determine the equilibrium constant of a reaction if we know the concentrations of reactants and products at equilibrium. The following example shows how to use the stoichiometry of the reaction and a combination of initial concentrations and equilibrium concentrations to determine an equilibrium constant. This technique, commonly called an ICE chart—for Initial, Change, and Equilibrium–will be helpful in solving many equilibrium problems. A chart is generated beginning with the equilibrium reaction in question. Underneath the reaction the initial concentrations of the reactants and products are listed—these conditions are usually provided in the problem and we consider no shift toward equilibrium to have happened. The next row of data is the change that occurs as the system shifts toward equilibrium—do not forget to consider the reaction stoichiometry as described in a previous section of this chapter. The last row contains the concentrations once equilibrium has been reached.

I−(aq) −(aq) I2(aq) + ⇌I3 I−both 10−3 × If a solution with the concentrations of I2 and equal to 1.000 M before reaction gives an 10−4 × M, what is the equilibrium constant for the reaction? equilibrium concentration of I2 of 6.61 Solution We will begin this problem by calculating the changes in concentration as the system goes to equilibrium. Then we determine the equilibrium concentrations and, finally, the equilibrium constant. First, we set up a table with the initial concentrations, the changes in concentrations, and the equilibrium concentrations using −x as the change in concentration of I2.

Chapter 13 | Fundamental Equilibrium Concepts 753 We are given all of the equilibrium concentrations except that of NO. Thus, we can solve for the missing equilibrium concentration by rearranging the equation for the equilibrium constant.

Answer: 1.53 mol/L Calculation of Changes in Concentration If we know the equilibrium constant for a reaction and a set of concentrations of reactants and products that are not at equilibrium, we can calculate the changes in concentrations as the system comes to equilibrium, as well as the new concentrations at equilibrium. The typical procedure can be summarized in four steps. Determine the direction the reaction proceeds to come to equilibrium. 1. Write a balanced chemical equation for the reaction. a. If the direction in which the reaction must proceed to reach equilibrium is not obvious, calculate Qc b. from the initial concentrations and compare to Kc to determine the direction of change. Determine the relative changes needed to reach equilibrium, then write the equilibrium concentrations in terms 2. of these changes. Define the changes in the initial concentrations that are needed for the reaction to reach equilibrium. a. Generally, we represent the smallest change with the symbol x and express the other changes in terms of the smallest change. Define missing equilibrium concentrations in terms of the initial concentrations and the changes in b. concentration determined in (a).

Check the arithmetic. 4. Check the calculated equilibrium concentrations by substituting them into the equilibrium expression a. and determining whether they give the equilibrium constant. Sometimes a particular step may differ from problem to problem—it may be more complex in some problems and less complex in others. However, every calculation of equilibrium concentrations from a set of initial concentrations will involve these steps. In solving equilibrium problems that involve changes in concentration, sometimes it is convenient to set up an ICE table, as described in the previous section. Example 13.8 Calculation of Concentration Changes as a Reaction Goes to Equilibrium Under certain conditions, the equilibrium constant for the decomposition of PCl5(g) into PCl3(g) and Cl2(g) is 0.0211. What are the equilibrium concentrations of PCl5, PCl3, and Cl2 if the initial concentration of PCl5 was 1.00 M? Solution Use the stepwise process described earlier. Determine the direction the reaction proceeds. Step 1. The balanced equation for the decomposition of PCl5 is PCl5(g) ⇌PCl3(g) + Cl2(g) Because we have no products initially, Qc = 0 and the reaction will proceed to the right. Determine the relative changes needed to reach equilibrium, then write the equilibrium Step 2. concentrations in terms of these changes. Let us represent the increase in concentration of PCl3 by the symbol x. The other changes may be written in terms of x by considering the coefficients in the chemical equation. PCl5(g) ⇌PCl3(g) + Cl2(g) −x x x The changes in concentration and the expressions for the equilibrium concentrations are: Solve for the change and the equilibrium concentrations. Step 3.

In this case, the second solution (−0.156) is physically impossible because we know the change must be a positive number (otherwise we would end up with negative values for concentrations of the products). Thus, x = 0.135 M. The equilibrium concentrations are ⎡ ⎤ ⎣PCl5 ⎦= 1.00 −0.135 = 0.87 M ⎡ ⎤ ⎣PCl3 ⎦= x = 0.135 M ⎡ ⎤ ⎣Cl2 ⎦= x = 0.135 M Check the arithmetic. Step 4.

H2(g) + I2(g) ⇌2HI(g) Answer: [H2] = 0.06 M, [I2] = 1.06 M, [HI] = 1.88 M Sometimes it is possible to use chemical insight to find solutions to equilibrium problems without actually solving a quadratic (or more complicated) equation. First, however, it is useful to verify that equilibrium can be obtained starting from two extremes: all (or mostly) reactants and all (or mostly) products (similar to what was shown in Figure 13.7). Consider the ionization of 0.150 M HA, a weak acid. ⇌H+(aq) A−(aq) 10−4 HA(aq) + Kc = 6.80 × The most obvious way to determine the equilibrium concentrations would be to start with only reactants. This could be called the “all reactant” starting point. Using x for the amount of acid ionized at equilibrium, this is the ICE table and solution.

This could be called the “all product” starting point. Assuming all of the HA ionizes gives [HA] = 0.150 −0.150 = 0 M [H+] = 0 + 0.150 = 0.150 M [A−] = 0 + 0.150 = 0.150 M https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

The “all reactant” starting point resulted in a relatively small change (x) because the system was close to equilibrium, while the “all product” starting point had a relatively large change (y) that was nearly the size of the initial concentrations. It can be said that a system that starts “close” to equilibrium will require only a ”small” change in conditions (x) to reach equilibrium. Recall that a small Kc means that very little of the reactants form products and a large Kc means that most of the reactants form products. If the system can be arranged so it starts “close” to equilibrium, then if the change (x) is small compared to any initial concentrations, it can be neglected. Small is usually defined as resulting in an error of less than 5%. The following two examples demonstrate this.

Chemical equilibrium is a dynamic process, meaning the rate of formation of products by the forward reaction is equal to the rate at which the products re-form reactants by the reverse reaction. 13.2 Equilibrium Constants For any reaction that is at equilibrium, the reaction quotient Q is equal to the equilibrium constant K for the reaction. If a reactant or product is a pure solid, a pure liquid, or the solvent in a dilute solution, the concentration of this component does not appear in the expression for the equilibrium constant. At equilibrium, the values of the concentrations of the reactants and products are constant. Their particular values may vary depending on conditions,

762 Chapter 13 | Fundamental Equilibrium Concepts but the value of the reaction quotient will always equal K (Kc when using concentrations or KP when using partial pressures). A homogeneous equilibrium is an equilibrium in which all components are in the same phase. A heterogeneous equilibrium is an equilibrium in which components are in two or more phases. We can decide whether a reaction is at equilibrium by comparing the reaction quotient with the equilibrium constant for the reaction. 13.3 Shifting Equilibria: Le Châtelier’s Principle Systems at equilibrium can be disturbed by changes to temperature, concentration, and, in some cases, volume and pressure; volume and pressure changes will disturb equilibrium if the number of moles of gas is different on the reactant and product sides of the reaction. The system's response to these disturbances is described by Le Châtelier's principle: The system will respond in a way that counteracts the disturbance. Not all changes to the system result in a disturbance of the equilibrium. Adding a catalyst affects the rates of the reactions but does not alter the equilibrium, and changing pressure or volume will not significantly disturb systems with no gases or with equal numbers of moles of gas on the reactant and product side. Effects of Disturbances of Equilibrium and K Disturbance Observed Change as Direction of Shift Effect Equilibrium is Restored on K reactant added added reactant is partially toward products none consumed product added added product is partially toward reactants none consumed decrease in volume/ pressure decreases toward side with fewer moles of gas none increase in gas pressure increase in volume/ pressure increases toward side with fewer moles of gas none decrease in gas pressure temperature increase heat is absorbed toward products for endothermic, changes toward reactants for exothermic temperature decrease heat is given off toward reactants for endothermic, changes toward products for exothermic Table 13.1 13.4 Equilibrium Calculations The ratios of the rate of change in concentrations of a reaction are equal to the ratios of the coefficients in the balanced chemical equation. The sign of the coefficient of X is positive when the concentration increases and negative when it decreases. We learned to approach three basic types of equilibrium problems. When given the concentrations of the reactants and products at equilibrium, we can solve for the equilibrium constant; when given the equilibrium constant and some of the concentrations involved, we can solve for the missing concentrations; and when given the equilibrium constant and the initial concentrations, we can solve for the concentrations at equilibrium. https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

Proteins, enzymes, blood, genetic material, and other components of living matter contain both acids and bases. We seem to like the sour taste of acids; we add them to soft drinks, salad dressings, and spices. Many foods, including citrus fruits and some vegetables, contain acids. Cleaners in our homes contain acids or bases. Acids and bases play important roles in the chemical industry. Currently, approximately 36 million metric tons of sulfuric acid are produced annually in the United States alone. Huge quantities of ammonia (8 million tons), urea (10 million tons), and phosphoric acid (10 million tons) are also produced annually. This chapter will illustrate the chemistry of acid-base reactions and equilibria, and provide you with tools for quantifying the concentrations of acids and bases in solutions.

778 Chapter 14 | Acid-Base Equilibria 14.1 Brønsted-Lowry Acids and Bases By the end of this section, you will be able to: Identify acids, bases, and conjugate acid-base pairs according to the Brønsted-Lowry definition • Write equations for acid and base ionization reactions • Use the ion-product constant for water to calculate hydronium and hydroxide ion concentrations • Describe the acid-base behavior of amphiprotic substances • Acids and bases have been known for a long time. When Robert Boyle characterized them in 1680, he noted that acids dissolve many substances, change the color of certain natural dyes (for example, they change litmus from blue to red), and lose these characteristic properties after coming into contact with alkalis (bases). In the eighteenth century, it was recognized that acids have a sour taste, react with limestone to liberate a gaseous substance (now known to be CO2), and interact with alkalis to form neutral substances. In 1815, Humphry Davy contributed greatly to the development of the modern acid-base concept by demonstrating that hydrogen is the essential constituent of acids. Around that same time, Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac concluded that acids are substances that can neutralize bases and that these two classes of substances can be defined only in terms of each other. The significance of hydrogen was reemphasized in 1884 when Carl Axel Arrhenius defined an acid as a compound that dissolves in water to yield hydrogen cations (now recognized to be hydronium ions) and a base as a compound that dissolves in water to yield hydroxide anions. In an earlier chapter on chemical reactions, we defined acids and bases as Arrhenius did: We identified an acid as a (H3O+) compound that dissolves in water to yield hydronium ions and a base as a compound that dissolves in water (OH−). to yield hydroxide ions This definition is not wrong; it is simply limited. Later, we extended the definition of an acid or a base using the more general definition proposed in 1923 by the Danish chemist Johannes Brønsted and the English chemist Thomas Lowry. Their definition centers on the proton, 1 H+. H, loses an electron. A compound that donates A proton is what remains when a normal hydrogen atom, 1 a proton to another compound is called a Brønsted-Lowry acid, and a compound that accepts a proton is called a Brønsted-Lowry base. An acid-base reaction is the transfer of a proton from a proton donor (acid) to a proton acceptor (base). In a subsequent chapter of this text we will introduce the most general model of acid-base behavior introduced by the American chemist G. N. Lewis. Acids may be compounds such as HCl or H2SO4, organic acids like acetic acid (CH3COOH) or ascorbic acid (vitamin −, −, −) +, HS−, H3O+, HSO4 H2 PO4 HCO3 NH4 C), or H2O. Anions (such as and and cations (such as and O)6]3+) [Al(H2 may also act as acids. Bases fall into the same three categories. Bases may be neutral molecules (such −, 2−, 3−), OH−, HS−, F−, HCO3 CO3 PO4 as H2O, NH3, and CH3NH2), anions (such as and or cations (such as OH]2+). [Al(H2 O)5 The most familiar bases are ionic compounds such as NaOH and Ca(OH)2, which contain the OH−. hydroxide ion, The hydroxide ion in these compounds accepts a proton from acids to form water: H+ OH−⟶H2 + O We call the product that remains after an acid donates a proton the conjugate base of the acid. This species is a base because it can accept a proton (to re-form the acid): https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

Chapter 14 | Acid-Base Equilibria 779 acid ⇌proton + conjugate base ⇌H+ F− HF + ⇌H+ − H2 SO4 + HSO4 ⇌H+ OH− H2 O + −⇌H+ 2− HSO4 + SO4 + ⇌H+ NH4 + NH3 We call the product that results when a base accepts a proton the base’s conjugate acid. This species is an acid because it can give up a proton (and thus re-form the base): base + proton ⇌conjugate acid OH−+ H+ ⇌H2 O H+ O+ H2 O + ⇌H3 H+ + NH3 + ⇌NH4 S2−+ H+ ⇌HS− 2−+ H+ − CO3 ⇌HCO3 F−+ H+ ⇌HF In these two sets of equations, the behaviors of acids as proton donors and bases as proton acceptors are represented in isolation. In reality, all acid-base reactions involve the transfer of protons between acids and bases. For example, consider the acid-base reaction that takes place when ammonia is dissolved in water. A water molecule (functioning as an acid) transfers a proton to an ammonia molecule (functioning as a base), yielding the conjugate base of water, + OH−, NH4 and the conjugate acid of ammonia, : The reaction between a Brønsted-Lowry acid and water is called acid ionization. For example, when hydrogen fluoride dissolves in water and ionizes, protons are transferred from hydrogen fluoride molecules to water molecules, yielding hydronium ions and fluoride ions: When we add a base to water, a base ionization reaction occurs in which protons are transferred from water molecules to base molecules. For example, adding ammonia to water yields hydroxide ions and ammonium ions:

780 Chapter 14 | Acid-Base Equilibria Notice that both these ionization reactions are represented as equilibrium processes. The relative extent to which these acid and base ionization reactions proceed is an important topic treated in a later section of this chapter. In the preceding paragraphs we saw that water can function as either an acid or a base, depending on the nature of the solute dissolved in it. In fact, in pure water or in any aqueous solution, water acts both as an acid and a base. A very small fraction of water molecules donate protons to other water molecules to form hydronium ions and hydroxide ions: This type of reaction, in which a substance ionizes when one molecule of the substance reacts with another molecule of the same substance, is referred to as autoionization. 109 Pure water undergoes autoionization to a very slight extent. Only about two out of every molecules in a sample of pure water are ionized at 25 °C. The equilibrium constant for the ionization of water is called the ion-product constant for water (Kw): OH−(aq) O+][OH−] O+(aq) + Kw = [H3 H2 O(l) + H2 O(l) ⇌H3 The slight ionization of pure water is reflected in the small value of the equilibrium constant; at 25 °C, Kw has a 10−14. × value of 1.0 The process is endothermic, and so the extent of ionization and the resulting concentrations of × hydronium ion and hydroxide ion increase with temperature. For example, at 100 °C, the value for Kw is about 5.1 10−13, roughly 100-times larger than the value at 25 °C. Example 14.1 Ion Concentrations in Pure Water What are the hydronium ion concentration and the hydroxide ion concentration in pure water at 25 °C?

The concentrations of these ions in a solution are often critical determinants of the solution’s properties and the chemical behaviors of its other solutes, and specific vocabulary has been developed to describe these concentrations in relative terms. A solution is neutral if it contains equal concentrations of hydronium and hydroxide ions; acidic if it contains a greater concentration of hydronium ions than hydroxide ions; and basic if it contains a lesser concentration of hydronium ions than hydroxide ions. A common means of expressing quantities, the values of which may span many orders of magnitude, is to use a logarithmic scale. One such scale that is very popular for chemical concentrations and equilibrium constants is based on the p-function, defined as shown where “X” is the quantity of interest and “log” is the base-10 logarithm: pX = −log X https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

Basic solutions are those with hydronium ion molarities less than 1.0 M and hydroxide ion 10−7 × M (corresponding to pH values greater than 7.00 and pOH values less than 7.00). molarities greater than 1.0 Since the autoionization constant Kw is temperature dependent, these correlations between pH values and the acidic/ neutral/basic adjectives will be different at temperatures other than 25 °C.

This distinction can be important when studying certain processes that occur at nonstandard temperatures, such as enzyme reactions in warm-blooded organisms.

Chapter 14 | Acid-Base Equilibria 787 Carbon dioxide is naturally present in the atmosphere because we and most other organisms produce it as a waste product of metabolism. Carbon dioxide is also formed when fires release carbon stored in vegetation or when we burn wood or fossil fuels. Sulfur trioxide in the atmosphere is naturally produced by volcanic activity, but it also stems from burning fossil fuels, which have traces of sulfur, and from the process of “roasting” ores of metal sulfides in metal-refining processes. Oxides of nitrogen are formed in internal combustion engines where the high temperatures make it possible for the nitrogen and oxygen in air to chemically combine. Acid rain is a particular problem in industrial areas where the products of combustion and smelting are released into the air without being stripped of sulfur and nitrogen oxides. In North America and Europe until the 1980s, it was responsible for the destruction of forests and freshwater lakes, when the acidity of the rain actually killed trees, damaged soil, and made lakes uninhabitable for all but the most acid-tolerant species. Acid rain also corrodes statuary and building facades that are made of marble and limestone (Figure 14.3). Regulations limiting the amount of sulfur and nitrogen oxides that can be released into the atmosphere by industry and automobiles have reduced the severity of acid damage to both natural and manmade environments in North America and Europe. It is now a growing problem in industrial areas of China and India.

790 Chapter 14 | Acid-Base Equilibria Figure 14.6 Some of the common strong acids and bases are listed here. The relative strengths of acids may be determined by measuring their equlibrium constants in aqueous solutions. In solutions of the same concentration, stronger acids ionize to a greater extent, and so yield higher concentrations of hydronium ions than do weaker acids. The equilibrium constant for an acid is called the acid-ionization constant, Ka. For the reaction of an acid HA: A−(aq), O+(aq) + HA(aq) + H2 O(l) ⇌H3 we write the equation for the ionization constant as: O+][A−] [H3 Ka = [HA] where the concentrations are those at equilibrium. Although water is a reactant in the reaction, it is the solvent as O+ H3 well, so we do not include [H2O] in the equation. The larger the Ka of an acid, the larger the concentration of A−relative and to the concentration of the nonionized acid, HA. Thus a stronger acid has a larger ionization constant than does a weaker acid. The ionization constants increase as the strengths of the acids increase. (A table of ionization Appendix H, Table 14.2.) constants of weak acids appears in with a partial listing in −: HSO4 The following data on acid-ionization constants indicate the order of acid strength CH3CO2H < HNO2 < 10−5 −(aq) O+(aq) + CH3 CO2 Ka = 1.8 × CH3 CO2 H(aq) + H2 O(l) ⇌H3 O+(aq) −(aq) 10−4 HNO2(aq) + H2 O(l) ⇌H3 + NO2 Ka = 4.6 × 2−(aq) 10−2 −(aq) O+(aq) + SO4 Ka = 1.2 × HSO4 + H2 O(aq) ⇌H3 Another measure of the strength of an acid is its percent ionization. The percent ionization of a weak acid is the ratio of the concentration of the ionized acid to the initial acid concentration, times 100: O+]eq [H3 % ionization = × 100 [HA]0 Because the ratio includes the initial concentration, the percent ionization for a solution of a given weak acid varies depending on the original concentration of the acid, and actually decreases with increasing acid concentration.

Check Your Learning Calculate the percent ionization of a 0.10-M solution of acetic acid with a pH of 2.89. Answer: 1.3% ionized We can rank the strengths of bases by their tendency to form hydroxide ions in aqueous solution. The reaction of a Brønsted-Lowry base with water is given by: ⇌HB+(aq) OH−(aq) B(aq) + H2 O(l) + HB+ Water is the acid that reacts with the base, is the conjugate acid of the base B, and the hydroxide ion is the OH−and HB+ conjugate base of water. A strong base yields 100% (or very nearly so) of when it reacts with water; Figure 14.6 lists several strong bases. A weak base yields a small proportion of hydroxide ions. Soluble ionic hydroxides such as NaOH are considered strong bases because they dissociate completely when dissolved in water. Link to Learning View the simulation (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/16AcidBase) of strong and weak acids and bases at the molecular level. As we did with acids, we can measure the relative strengths of bases by measuring their base-ionization constant (Kb) in aqueous solutions. In solutions of the same concentration, stronger bases ionize to a greater extent, and so yield higher hydroxide ion concentrations than do weaker bases. A stronger base has a larger ionization constant than does a weaker base. For the reaction of a base, B: ⇌HB+(aq) OH−(aq), B(aq) + H2 O(l) + we write the equation for the ionization constant as: [HB+][OH−] Kb = [B]

NH4 NH4 × Answer: is the slightly stronger acid (Ka for = 5.6 The Ionization of Weak Acids and Weak Bases Many acids and bases are weak; that is, they do not ionize fully in aqueous solution. A solution of a weak acid in water is a mixture of the nonionized acid, hydronium ion, and the conjugate base of the acid, with the nonionized acid present in the greatest concentration. Thus, a weak acid increases the hydronium ion concentration in an aqueous solution (but not as much as the same amount of a strong acid). Acetic acid, CH3CO2H, is a weak acid. When we add acetic acid to water, it ionizes to a small extent according to the equation: −(aq), O+(aq) CH3 CO2 H(aq) + H2 O(l) ⇌H3 + CH3 CO2 giving an equilibrium mixture with most of the acid present in the nonionized (molecular) form. This equilibrium, like other equilibria, is dynamic; acetic acid molecules donate hydrogen ions to water molecules and form hydronium ions and acetate ions at the same rate that hydronium ions donate hydrogen ions to acetate ions to reform acetic acid molecules and water molecules. We can tell by measuring the pH of an aqueous solution of known concentration that (Figure 14.9). only a fraction of the weak acid is ionized at any moment The remaining weak acid is present in the nonionized form.

At equilibrium, a solution of a weak base in water is a mixture of the nonionized base, the conjugate acid of the weak base, and hydroxide ion with the nonionized base present in the greatest concentration. Thus, a weak base increases the hydroxide ion concentration in an aqueous solution (but not as much as the same amount of a strong base). For example, a solution of the weak base trimethylamine, (CH3)3N, in water reacts according to the equation: NH+(aq) OH−(aq), (CH3)3 N(aq) + H2 O(l) ⇌(CH3)3 + giving an equilibrium mixture with most of the base present as the nonionized amine. This equilibrium is analogous to that described for weak acids. We can confirm by measuring the pH of an aqueous solution of a weak base of known concentration that only a (Figure 14.10). fraction of the base reacts with water The remaining weak base is present as the unreacted form.

Answer: pH 11.16 The Relative Strengths of Strong Acids and Bases Strong acids, such as HCl, HBr, and HI, all exhibit the same strength in water. The water molecule is such a strong Cl−, Br−, I−that base compared to the conjugate bases and ionization of these strong acids is essentially complete in aqueous solutions. In solvents less basic than water, we find HCl, HBr, and HI differ markedly in their tendency to give up a proton to the solvent. For example, when dissolved in ethanol (a weaker base than water), the extent of ionization increases in the order HCl < HBr < HI, and so HI is demonstrated to be the strongest of these acids. The inability to discern differences in strength among strong acids dissolved in water is known as the leveling effect of water. O2−, Water also exerts a leveling effect on the strengths of strong bases. For example, the oxide ion, and the amide −, NH2 ion, are such strong bases that they react completely with water: OH−(aq) O2−(aq) ⟶OH−(aq) + + H2 O(l) OH−(aq) −(aq) ⟶NH3(aq) + NH2 + H2 O(l) −appear O2−and NH2 Thus, to have the same base strength in water; they both give a 100% yield of hydroxide ion. https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

Chapter 14 | Acid-Base Equilibria 807 Effect of Molecular Structure on Acid-Base Strength In the absence of any leveling effect, the acid strength of binary compounds of hydrogen with nonmetals (A) increases as the H-A bond strength decreases down a group in the periodic table. For group 7A, the order of increasing acidity is HF < HCl < HBr < HI. Likewise, for group 6A, the order of increasing acid strength is H2O < H2S < H2Se < H2Te. Across a row in the periodic table, the acid strength of binary hydrogen compounds increases with increasing electronegativity of the nonmetal atom because the polarity of the H-A bond increases. Thus, the order of increasing acidity (for removal of one proton) across the second row is CH4 < NH3 < H2O < HF; across the third row, it is SiH4 Figure 14.13). < PH3 < H2S < HCl (see Figure 14.13 As you move from left to right and down the periodic table, the acid strength increases. As you move from right to left and up, the base strength increases. Compounds containing oxygen and one or more hydroxyl (OH) groups can be acidic, basic, or amphoteric, depending on the position in the periodic table of the central atom E, the atom bonded to the hydroxyl group. Such compounds have the general formula OnE(OH)m, and include sulfuric acid, O2S(OH)2, sulfurous acid, OS(OH)2, nitric acid, O2NOH, perchloric acid, O3ClOH, aluminum hydroxide, Al(OH)3, calcium hydroxide, Ca(OH)2, and potassium hydroxide, KOH: If the central atom, E, has a low electronegativity, its attraction for electrons is low. Little tendency exists for the central atom to form a strong covalent bond with the oxygen atom, and bond a between the element and oxygen is more readily broken than bond b between oxygen and hydrogen. Hence bond a is ionic, hydroxide ions are released to the solution, and the material behaves as a base—this is the case with Ca(OH)2 and KOH. Lower electronegativity is characteristic of the more metallic elements; hence, the metallic elements form ionic hydroxides that are by definition basic compounds. If, on the other hand, the atom E has a relatively high electronegativity, it strongly attracts the electrons it shares with the oxygen atom, making bond a relatively strongly covalent. The oxygen-hydrogen bond, bond b, is thereby weakened because electrons are displaced toward E. Bond b is polar and readily releases hydrogen ions to the

808 Chapter 14 | Acid-Base Equilibria solution, so the material behaves as an acid. High electronegativities are characteristic of the more nonmetallic elements. Thus, nonmetallic elements form covalent compounds containing acidic −OH groups that are called oxyacids. Increasing the oxidation number of the central atom E also increases the acidity of an oxyacid because this increases the attraction of E for the electrons it shares with oxygen and thereby weakens the O-H bond. Sulfuric acid, H2SO4, or O2S(OH)2 (with a sulfur oxidation number of +6), is more acidic than sulfurous acid, H2SO3, or OS(OH)2 (with a sulfur oxidation number of +4). Likewise nitric acid, HNO3, or O2NOH (N oxidation number = +5), is more acidic than nitrous acid, HNO2, or ONOH (N oxidation number = +3). In each of these pairs, the oxidation number of the (Figure 14.14). central atom is larger for the stronger acid Figure 14.14 As the oxidation number of the central atom E increases, the acidity also increases. Hydroxy compounds of elements with intermediate electronegativities and relatively high oxidation numbers (for example, elements near the diagonal line separating the metals from the nonmetals in the periodic table) are usually amphoteric. This means that the hydroxy compounds act as acids when they react with strong bases and as bases when they react with strong acids. The amphoterism of aluminum hydroxide, which commonly exists as the hydrate Al(H2O)3(OH)3, is reflected in its solubility in both strong acids and strong bases. In strong bases, the relatively O)2(OH)4]−, [Al(H2 insoluble hydrated aluminum hydroxide, Al(H2O)3(OH)3, is converted into the soluble ion, by reaction with hydroxide ion: O)2(OH)4]−(aq) OH−(aq) [Al(H2 Al(H2 O)3(OH)3(aq) + ⇌H2 O(l) + In this reaction, a proton is transferred from one of the aluminum-bound H2O molecules to a hydroxide ion in solution. The Al(H2O)3(OH)3 compound thus acts as an acid under these conditions. On the other hand, when O)6]3+ [Al(H2 dissolved in strong acids, it is converted to the soluble ion by reaction with hydronium ion: 3+(aq) O+(aq) 3H3 + Al(H2 O)3(OH)3(aq) ⇌Al(H2 O)6 + 3H2 O(l) In this case, protons are transferred from hydronium ions in solution to Al(H2O)3(OH)3, and the compound functions as a base. https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

Chapter 14 | Acid-Base Equilibria 809 14.4 Hydrolysis of Salt Solutions By the end of this section, you will be able to: Predict whether a salt solution will be acidic, basic, or neutral • Calculate the concentrations of the various species in a salt solution • Describe the process that causes solutions of certain metal ions to be acidic • As we have seen in the section on chemical reactions, when an acid and base are mixed, they undergo a neutralization reaction. The word “neutralization” seems to imply that a stoichiometrically equivalent solution of an acid and a base would be neutral. This is sometimes true, but the salts that are formed in these reactions may have acidic or basic properties of their own, as we shall now see. Acid-Base Neutralization A solution is neutral when it contains equal concentrations of hydronium and hydroxide ions. When we mix solutions of an acid and a base, an acid-base neutralization reaction occurs. However, even if we mix stoichiometrically equivalent quantities, we may find that the resulting solution is not neutral. It could contain either an excess of hydronium ions or an excess of hydroxide ions because the nature of the salt formed determines whether the solution is acidic, neutral, or basic. The following four situations illustrate how solutions with various pH values can arise following a neutralization reaction using stoichiometrically equivalent quantities: A strong acid and a strong base, such as HCl(aq) and NaOH(aq) will react to form a neutral solution since the 1. Figure 14.8): conjugate partners produced are of negligible strength (see HCl(aq) + NaOH(aq) ⇌NaCl(aq) + H2 O(l) A strong acid and a weak base yield a weakly acidic solution, not because of the strong acid involved, but 2. because of the conjugate acid of the weak base. A weak acid and a strong base yield a weakly basic solution. A solution of a weak acid reacts with a solution 3. of a strong base to form the conjugate base of the weak acid and the conjugate acid of the strong base. The conjugate acid of the strong base is a weaker acid than water and has no effect on the acidity of the resulting solution. However, the conjugate base of the weak acid is a weak base and ionizes slightly in water. This increases the amount of hydroxide ion in the solution produced in the reaction and renders it slightly basic. A weak acid plus a weak base can yield either an acidic, basic, or neutral solution. This is the most complex 4. of the four types of reactions. When the conjugate acid and the conjugate base are of unequal strengths, the solution can be either acidic or basic, depending on the relative strengths of the two conjugates. Occasionally the weak acid and the weak base will have the same strength, so their respective conjugate base and acid will have the same strength, and the solution will be neutral. To predict whether a particular combination will be acidic, basic or neutral, tabulated K values of the conjugates must be compared. Chemistry in Everyday Life Stomach Antacids Our stomachs contain a solution of roughly 0.03 M HCl, which helps us digest the food we eat. The burning sensation associated with heartburn is a result of the acid of the stomach leaking through the muscular valve at the top of the stomach into the lower reaches of the esophagus. The lining of the esophagus is not protected from the corrosive effects of stomach acid the way the lining of the stomach is, and the results can be very painful. When we have heartburn, it feels better if we reduce the excess acid in the esophagus by taking

The reaction, CaCO3(s) + 2HCl(aq) ⇌CaCl2(aq) + H2 O(l) + CO2(g) not only neutralizes stomach acid, it also produces CO2(g), which may result in a satisfying belch. Milk of Magnesia is a suspension of the sparingly soluble base magnesium hydroxide, Mg(OH)2. It works according to the reaction: ⇌Mg2+(aq) 2OH−(aq) Mg(OH)2(s) + The hydroxide ions generated in this equilibrium then go on to react with the hydronium ions from the stomach acid, so that : O+ OH−⇌2H2 H3 + O(l) This reaction does not produce carbon dioxide, but magnesium-containing antacids can have a laxative effect. Several antacids have aluminum hydroxide, Al(OH)3, as an active ingredient. The aluminum hydroxide tends to cause constipation, and some antacids use aluminum hydroxide in concert with magnesium hydroxide to balance the side effects of the two substances. Chemistry in Everyday Life Culinary Aspects of Chemistry Cooking is essentially synthetic chemistry that happens to be safe to eat. There are a number of examples of acid-base chemistry in the culinary world. One example is the use of baking soda, or sodium bicarbonate in baking. NaHCO3 is a base. When it reacts with an acid such as lemon juice, buttermilk, or sour cream in a batter, bubbles of carbon dioxide gas are formed from decomposition of the resulting carbonic acid, and the batter “rises.” Baking powder is a combination of sodium bicarbonate, and one or more acid salts that react when the two chemicals come in contact with water in the batter. Many people like to put lemon juice or vinegar, both of which are acids, on cooked fish (Figure 14.15). It turns out that fish have volatile amines (bases) in their systems, which are neutralized by the acids to yield involatile ammonium salts. This reduces the odor of the fish, and also adds a “sour” taste that we seem to enjoy. https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

Pickling is a method used to preserve vegetables using a naturally produced acidic environment. The vegetable, such as a cucumber, is placed in a sealed jar submerged in a brine solution. The brine solution favors the growth of beneficial bacteria and suppresses the growth of harmful bacteria. The beneficial bacteria feed on starches in the cucumber and produce lactic acid as a waste product in a process called fermentation. The lactic acid eventually increases the acidity of the brine to a level that kills any harmful bacteria, which require a basic environment. Without the harmful bacteria consuming the cucumbers they are able to last much longer than if they were unprotected. A byproduct of the pickling process changes the flavor of the vegetables with the acid making them taste sour. Salts of Weak Bases and Strong Acids When we neutralize a weak base with a strong acid, the product is a salt containing the conjugate acid of the weak base. This conjugate acid is a weak acid. For example, ammonium chloride, NH4Cl, is a salt formed by the reaction of the weak base ammonia with the strong acid HCl: Cl(aq) NH3(aq) + HCl(aq) ⟶NH4 A solution of this salt contains ammonium ions and chloride ions. The chloride ion has no effect on the acidity of the solution since HCl is a strong acid. Chloride is a very weak base and will not accept a proton to a measurable extent. However, the ammonium ion, the conjugate acid of ammonia, reacts with water and increases the hydronium ion concentration: +(aq) O+(aq) NH4 + H2 O(l) ⇌H3 + NH3(aq)

Salts of Weak Acids and Strong Bases When we neutralize a weak acid with a strong base, we get a salt that contains the conjugate base of the weak acid. This conjugate base is usually a weak base. For example, sodium acetate, NaCH3CO2, is a salt formed by the reaction of the weak acid acetic acid with the strong base sodium hydroxide: H(aq) + NaOH(aq) CO2(aq) + H2 O(aq) CH3 CO2 ⟶NaCH3 A solution of this salt contains sodium ions and acetate ions. The sodium ion, as the conjugate acid of a strong base, has no effect on the acidity of the solution. However, the acetate ion, the conjugate base of acetic acid, reacts with water and increases the concentration of hydroxide ion: OH−(aq) −(aq) + H2 O(l) ⇌CH3 CO2 H(aq) + CH3 CO2 −. CH3 CO2 The equilibrium equation for this reaction is the ionization constant, Kb, for the base The value of Kb can be calculated from the value of the ionization constant of water, Kw, and Ka, the ionization constant of the conjugate acid of the anion using the equation: Kw = Ka × Kb For the acetate ion and its conjugate acid we have: 10−14 Kw 1.0 × 10−10 −) Kb (for CH3 CO2 = = 5.6 × = Ka (for CH3 CO2 H) 10−5 1.8 × Some handbooks do not report values of Kb.

What this means is that the aluminum ion has the strongest interactions with the six closest water molecules (the so-called first solvation shell), 3+ Al(H2 O)6 even though it does interact with the other water molecules surrounding this cluster as well: 3+(aq) −(aq) 6H2 O(l) ⟶Al(H2 O)6 + 3NO3 Al(NO3)3(s) + “Al3+(aq)”, We frequently see the formula of this ion simply as without explicitly noting the six water molecules that are the closest ones to the aluminum ion and just describing the ion as being solvated in water (hydrated). This is H3O+ H+. similar to the simplification of the formula of the hydronium ion, to However, in this case, the hydrated (Figure 14.16) aluminum ion is a weak acid and donates a proton to a water molecule. Thus, the hydration becomes important and we may use formulas that show the extent of hydration: O)5(OH)2+(aq) 3+(aq) 10−5 O+(aq) ⇌H3 + Al(H2 Ka = 1.4 × Al(H2 O)6 + H2 O(l) As with other polyprotic acids, the hydrated aluminum ion ionizes in stages, as shown by: O)5(OH)2+(aq) 3+(aq) O+(aq) + H2 O(l) ⇌H3 + Al(H2 Al(H2 O)6 O)5(OH)2+(aq) O+(aq) +(aq) Al(H2 + H2 O(l) ⇌H3 + Al(H2 O)4(OH)2 O+(aq) +(aq) ⇌H3 + Al(H2 O)3(OH)3(aq) Al(H2 O)4(OH)2 + H2 O(l) Note that some of these aluminum species are exhibiting amphiprotic behavior, since they are acting as acids when they appear on the right side of the equilibrium expressions and as bases when they appear on the left side.

However, practically all hydrated metal ions other than those of the alkali metals ionize to give acidic solutions. Ionization increases as the charge of the metal ion increases or as the size of the metal ion decreases. 14.5 Polyprotic Acids By the end of this section, you will be able to: Extend previously introduced equilibrium concepts to acids and bases that may donate or accept more • than one proton We can classify acids by the number of protons per molecule that they can give up in a reaction. Acids such as HCl, HNO3, and HCN that contain one ionizable hydrogen atom in each molecule are called monoprotic acids. Their reactions with water are: O+(aq) Cl−(aq) ⟶H3 + HCl(aq) + H2 O(l) O+(aq) −(aq) HNO3(aq) + H2 O(l) ⟶H3 + NO3 O+(aq) CN−(aq) HCN(aq) + H2 O(l) ⟶H3 + Even though it contains four hydrogen atoms, acetic acid, CH3CO2H, is also monoprotic because only the hydrogen atom from the carboxyl group (COOH) reacts with bases: 

--- Page 826 ---
818 Chapter 14 | Acid-Base Equilibria Similarly, monoprotic bases are bases that will accept a single proton. Diprotic acids contain two ionizable hydrogen atoms per molecule; ionization of such acids occurs in two steps. The first ionization always takes place to a greater extent than the second ionization. For example, sulfuric acid, a strong acid, ionizes as follows: −(aq) 102+ O+(aq) + HSO4 Ka1 = about First ionization: H2 SO4(aq) + H2 O(l) ⇌H3 −(aq) O+(aq) 2−(aq) 10−2 Second ionization: HSO4 + H2 O(l) ⇌H3 + SO4 Ka2 = 1.2 × This stepwise ionization process occurs for all polyprotic acids. When we make a solution of a weak diprotic acid, we get a solution that contains a mixture of acids. Carbonic acid, H2CO3, is an example of a weak diprotic acid. The first ionization of carbonic acid yields hydronium ions and bicarbonate ions in small amounts. First ionization: O+][HCO3 −] [H3 10−7 O+(aq) −(aq) H2 CO3(aq) + H2 O(l) ⇌H3 = 4.3 × + HCO3 KH2 = CO3 [H2 CO3] The bicarbonate ion can also act as an acid. It ionizes and forms hydronium ions and carbonate ions in even smaller quantities. Second ionization: O+][CO3 2−] [H3 2−(aq) 10−11 −(aq) O+(aq) + CO3 KHCO3 −= HCO3 = 4.7 × + H2 O(l) ⇌H3 −] [HCO3 104, KH2CO3 KHCO3 is larger than −by a factor of so H2CO3 is the dominant producer of hydronium ion in the −formed HCO3 solution. This means that little of the by the ionization of H2CO3 ionizes to give hydronium ions −are H3O+ HCO3 (and carbonate ions), and the concentrations of and practically equal in a pure aqueous solution of H2CO3. If the first ionization constant of a weak diprotic acid is larger than the second by a factor of at least 20, it is appropriate to treat the first ionization separately and calculate concentrations resulting from it before calculating concentrations of species resulting from subsequent ionization. This can simplify our work considerably because H3O+ we can determine the concentration of and the conjugate base from the first ionization, then determine the concentration of the conjugate base of the second ionization in a solution with concentrations determined by the first ionization. Example 14.19 Ionization of a Diprotic Acid When we buy soda water (carbonated water), we are buying a solution of carbon dioxide in water.

This is due to the fact that each subsequent dissociation occurs to a lesser degree (as acid gets weaker). A triprotic acid is an acid that has three dissociable protons that undergo stepwise ionization: Phosphoric acid is a typical example: 10−3 −(aq) O+(aq) + H2 PO4 7.5 × Ka1 = First ionization: H3 PO4(aq) + H2 O(l) ⇌H3 10−8 −(aq) O+(aq) 2−(aq) Second ionization: H2 PO4 + HPO4 6.3 × + H2 O(l) ⇌H3 Ka2 = 3−(aq) 10−13 2−(aq) O+(aq) Third ionization: HPO4 + H2 O(l) ⇌H3 + PO4 Ka3 = 3.6 × As with the diprotic acids, the differences in the ionization constants of these reactions tell us that in each successive step the degree of ionization is significantly weaker. This is a general characteristic of polyprotic acids and successive 105 106. ionization constants often differ by a factor of about to This set of three dissociation reactions may appear to make calculations of equilibrium concentrations in a solution 105 106, of H3PO4 complicated. However, because the successive ionization constants differ by a factor of to the calculations can be broken down into a series of parts similar to those for diprotic acids. Polyprotic bases can accept more than one hydrogen ion in solution. The carbonate ion is an example of a diprotic base, since it can accept up to two protons. Solutions of alkali metal carbonates are quite alkaline, due to the reactions: 2−(aq) −(aq) OH−(aq) −(aq) OH−(aq) H2 O(l) + CO3 ⇌HCO3 + and H2 O(l) + HCO3 ⇌H2 CO3(aq) + https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

Chapter 14 | Acid-Base Equilibria 821 14.6 Buffers By the end of this section, you will be able to: Describe the composition and function of acid–base buffers • Calculate the pH of a buffer before and after the addition of added acid or base • A mixture of a weak acid and its conjugate base (or a mixture of a weak base and its conjugate acid) is called a buffer solution, or a buffer. Buffer solutions resist a change in pH when small amounts of a strong acid or a strong base are (Figure 14.17). added A solution of acetic acid and sodium acetate (CH3COOH + CH3COONa) is an example of a buffer that consists of a weak acid and its salt. An example of a buffer that consists of a weak base and its salt is a solution of ammonia and ammonium chloride (NH3(aq) + NH4Cl(aq)). Figure 14.17 (a) The buffered solution on the left and the unbuffered solution on the right have the same pH (pH 8); they are basic, showing the yellow color of the indicator methyl orange at this pH. (b) After the addition of 1 mL of a 0.01-M HCl solution, the buffered solution has not detectably changed its pH but the unbuffered solution has become acidic, as indicated by the change in color of the methyl orange, which turns red at a pH of about 4. (credit: modification of work by Mark Ott) How Buffers Work A mixture of acetic acid and sodium acetate is acidic because the Ka of acetic acid is greater than the Kb of its conjugate base acetate. It is a buffer because it contains both the weak acid and its salt. Hence, it acts to keep the hydronium ion concentration (and the pH) almost constant by the addition of either a small amount of a strong acid or a strong base. If we add a base such as sodium hydroxide, the hydroxide ions react with the few hydronium ions present. Then more of the acetic acid reacts with water, restoring the hydronium ion concentration almost to its original value: O+(aq) −(aq) ⟶H3 + CH3 CO2 CH3 CO2 H(aq) + H2 O(l) The pH changes very little. If we add an acid such as hydrochloric acid, most of the hydronium ions from the hydrochloric acid combine with acetate ions, forming acetic acid molecules: −(aq) O+(aq) H3 + CH3 CO2 ⟶CH3 CO2 H(aq) + H2 O(l) Thus, there is very little increase in the concentration of the hydronium ion, and the pH remains practically unchanged (Figure 14.18). 

--- Page 830 ---
822 Chapter 14 | Acid-Base Equilibria Figure 14.18 This diagram shows the buffer action of these reactions. A mixture of ammonia and ammonium chloride is basic because the Kb for ammonia is greater than the Ka for the ammonium ion. It is a buffer because it also contains the salt of the weak base. If we add a base (hydroxide ions), ammonium ions in the buffer react with the hydroxide ions to form ammonia and water and reduce the hydroxide ion concentration almost to its original value: +(aq) OH−(aq) NH4 + ⟶NH3(aq) + H2 O(l) If we add an acid (hydronium ions), ammonia molecules in the buffer mixture react with the hydronium ions to form ammonium ions and reduce the hydronium ion concentration almost to its original value: O+(aq) +(aq) H2 O(l) H3 + NH3(aq) ⟶NH4 + The three parts of the following example illustrate the change in pH that accompanies the addition of base to a buffered solution of a weak acid and to an unbuffered solution of a strong acid.

Buffer Capacity (Figure 14.19). Buffer solutions do not have an unlimited capacity to keep the pH relatively constant If we add so much base to a buffer that the weak acid is exhausted, no more buffering action toward the base is possible. On the other hand, if we add an excess of acid, the weak base would be exhausted, and no more buffering action toward 

--- Page 834 ---
826 Chapter 14 | Acid-Base Equilibria any additional acid would be possible. In fact, we do not even need to exhaust all of the acid or base in a buffer to overwhelm it; its buffering action will diminish rapidly as a given component nears depletion. Figure 14.19 The indicator color (methyl orange) shows that a small amount of acid added to a buffered solution of pH 8 (beaker on the left) has little affect on the buffered system (middle beaker). However, a large amount of acid exhausts the buffering capacity of the solution and the pH changes dramatically (beaker on the right). (credit: modification of work by Mark Ott) The buffer capacity is the amount of acid or base that can be added to a given volume of a buffer solution before the pH changes significantly, usually by one unit. Buffer capacity depends on the amounts of the weak acid and its conjugate base that are in a buffer mixture. For example, 1 L of a solution that is 1.0 M in acetic acid and 1.0 M in sodium acetate has a greater buffer capacity than 1 L of a solution that is 0.10 M in acetic acid and 0.10 M in sodium acetate even though both solutions have the same pH. The first solution has more buffer capacity because it contains more acetic acid and acetate ion. Selection of Suitable Buffer Mixtures There are two useful rules of thumb for selecting buffer mixtures: A good buffer mixture should have about equal concentrations of both of its components. A buffer solution 1. has generally lost its usefulness when one component of the buffer pair is less than about 10% of the other. Figure 14.20 shows an acetic acid-acetate ion buffer as base is added. The initial pH is 4.74. A change of 1 pH unit occurs when the acetic acid concentration is reduced to 11% of the acetate ion concentration. https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

Chapter 14 | Acid-Base Equilibria 827 Figure 14.20 The graph, an illustration of buffering action, shows change of pH as an increasing amount of a 0.10-M NaOH solution is added to 100 mL of a buffer solution in which, initially, [CH3CO2H] = 0.10 M and −] [CH3 CO2 = 0.10 M. Weak acids and their salts are better as buffers for pHs less than 7; weak bases and their salts are better as 2. buffers for pHs greater than 7. Blood is an important example of a buffered solution, with the principal acid and ion responsible for the buffering −. HCO3 action being carbonic acid, H2CO3, and the bicarbonate ion, When an excess of hydrogen ion enters the blood stream, it is removed primarily by the reaction: O+(aq) −(aq) ⟶H2 CO3(aq) + H2 O(l) H3 + HCO3 When an excess of the hydroxide ion is present, it is removed by the reaction: −(aq) OH−(aq) CO3(aq) ⟶HCO3 + H2 O(l) + H2 The pH of human blood thus remains very near 7.35, that is, slightly basic. Variations are usually less than 0.1 of a pH unit. A change of 0.4 of a pH unit is likely to be fatal. The Henderson-Hasselbalch Equation The ionization-constant expression for a solution of a weak acid can be written as: O+][A−] [H3 Ka = [HA] [H3O+], Rearranging to solve for we get: [HA] O+] [H3 = Ka × [A−] Taking the negative logarithm of both sides of this equation, we arrive at: 

--- Page 836 ---
828 Chapter 14 | Acid-Base Equilibria log[HA] O+] −log[H3 = −logKa− , [A−] which can be written as [A−] pKa + pH = log [HA] where pKa is the negative of the common logarithm of the ionization constant of the weak acid (pKa = −log Ka). This equation relates the pH, the ionization constant of a weak acid, and the concentrations of the weak acid and its salt in a buffered solution. Scientists often use this expression, called the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, to calculate the pH of buffer solutions. It is important to note that the “x is small” assumption must be valid to use this equation. Portrait of a Chemist Lawrence Joseph Henderson and Karl Albert Hasselbalch Lawrence Joseph Henderson (1878–1942) was an American physician, biochemist and physiologist, to name only a few of his many pursuits. He obtained a medical degree from Harvard and then spent 2 years studying in Strasbourg, then a part of Germany, before returning to take a lecturer position at Harvard. He eventually became a professor at Harvard and worked there his entire life. He discovered that the acid-base balance in human blood is regulated by a buffer system formed by the dissolved carbon dioxide in blood. He wrote an equation in 1908 to describe the carbonic acid-carbonate buffer system in blood. Henderson was broadly knowledgeable; in addition to his important research on the physiology of blood, he also wrote on the adaptations of organisms and their fit with their environments, on sociology and on university education. He also founded the Fatigue Laboratory, at the Harvard Business School, which examined human physiology with specific focus on work in industry, exercise, and nutrition. In 1916, Karl Albert Hasselbalch (1874–1962), a Danish physician and chemist, shared authorship in a paper with Christian Bohr in 1904 that described the Bohr effect, which showed that the ability of hemoglobin in the blood to bind with oxygen was inversely related to the acidity of the blood and the concentration of carbon dioxide. The pH scale was introduced in 1909 by another Dane, Sørensen, and in 1912, Hasselbalch published measurements of the pH of blood. In 1916, Hasselbalch expressed Henderson’s equation in logarithmic terms, consistent with the logarithmic scale of pH, and thus the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation was born. How Sciences Interconnect Medicine: The Buffer System in Blood The normal pH of human blood is about 7.4. The carbonate buffer system in the blood uses the following equilibrium reaction: −(aq) O+(aq) CO2(g) + 2H2 O(l) ⇌H2 CO3(aq) ⇌HCO3 + H3 The concentration of carbonic acid, H2CO3 is approximately 0.0012 M, and the concentration of the hydrogen −, HCO3 carbonate ion, is around 0.024 M. Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation and the pKa of carbonic acid at body temperature, we can calculate the pH of blood: [base] 0.024 pH = pKa + log = 6.1 + log = 7.4 0.0012 [acid] −ion HCO3 The fact that the H2CO3 concentration is significantly lower than that of the may seem unusual, but this imbalance is due to the fact that most of the by-products of our metabolism that enter our bloodstream https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

Chapter 14 | Acid-Base Equilibria 829 are acidic. Therefore, there must be a larger proportion of base than acid, so that the capacity of the buffer will not be exceeded. Lactic acid is produced in our muscles when we exercise. As the lactic acid enters the bloodstream, it is −ion, HCO3 neutralized by the producing H2CO3. An enzyme then accelerates the breakdown of the excess carbonic acid to carbon dioxide and water, which can be eliminated by breathing. In fact, in addition to the regulating effects of the carbonate buffering system on the pH of blood, the body uses breathing to regulate blood pH. If the pH of the blood decreases too far, an increase in breathing removes CO2 from the blood [H3O+] through the lungs driving the equilibrium reaction such that is lowered. If the blood is too alkaline, a lower breath rate increases CO2 concentration in the blood, driving the equilibrium reaction the other way, [H+] increasing and restoring an appropriate pH.

In this section, we will explore the changes in the concentrations of the acidic and basic species present in a solution during the process of a titration. Titration Curve Previously, when we studied acid-base reactions in solution, we focused only on the point at which the acid and base were stoichiometrically equivalent. No consideration was given to the pH of the solution before, during, or after the neutralization. Example 14.21 Calculating pH for Titration Solutions: Strong Acid/Strong Base A titration is carried out for 25.00 mL of 0.100 M HCl (strong acid) with 0.100 M of a strong base NaOH Figure 14.21. the titration curve is shown in Calculate the pH at these volumes of added base solution: (a) 0.00 mL

When the base solution is added, it also dissociates completely, providing H3O+ OH−ions The and neutralize each other, so only those of the two that were in excess remain, and their concentration determines the pH. Thus, the solution is initially acidic (pH < 7), but eventually all the hydronium ions present from the original acid are neutralized, and the solution becomes neutral. As more base is added, the solution turns basic. The total initial amount of the hydronium ions is: n(H+)0 O+]0 = [H3 × 0.02500 L = 0.002500 mol OH−ions Once X mL of the 0.100-M base solution is added, the number of moles of the introduced is: ⎛ ⎞ 1 L n(OH−)0 = 0.100 M × X mL × ⎝ ⎠ 1000 mL mL)⎛ ⎞ 1 L V = (25.00 mL + X ⎝ ⎠ The total volume becomes: 1000 mL H3O+ The number of moles of becomes: ⎛ ⎞ 1 L n(H+) n(H+)0 −n(OH−)0 = = 0.002500 mol −0.100 M × X mL × ⎝ ⎠ 1000 mL H3O+ The concentration of is: ⎞ ⎛ 1 L 0.002500 mol −0.100 M × X mL × n(H+) ⎠ ⎝ O+] 1000 mL [H3 = = ⎞ mL)⎛ V 1 L (25.00 mL + X ⎠ ⎝ 1000 mL ⎛ ⎞ ⎝1000 mL ⎠−0.100 M × X mL 0.002500 mol × 1 L = 25.00 mL + X mL O+]) pH = −log([H3 n(H+)0 −n(OH−)0 n(H+)0 n(OH−)0, n(H+) > 0 = The preceding calculations work if and so > 0. When H3O+ OH−ions the ions from the acid and the from the base mutually neutralize. At this point, the only OH−particles hydronium ions left are those from the autoionization of water, and there are no to neutralize them.

The values of the pH measured after successive additions of small amounts of NaOH are listed in the first column of this table, and are graphed in Figure 14.21, in a form that is called a titration curve. The pH increases slowly at first, increases rapidly in the middle portion of the curve, and then increases slowly again. The point of inflection (located at the midpoint of the vertical part of the curve) is the equivalence point for the titration. It indicates when equivalent quantities of acid and base are present. For the titration of a strong acid with a strong base, the equivalence point occurs at a pH of 7.00 and (Table 14.4 Figure 14.21). the points on the titration curve can be calculated using solution stoichiometry and 3.

Chapter 14 | Acid-Base Equilibria 833 Figure 14.21 (a) The titration curve for the titration of 25.00 mL of 0.100 M CH3CO2H (weak acid) with 0.100 M NaOH (strong base) has an equivalence point of 7.00 pH. (b) The titration curve for the titration of 25.00 mL of 0.100 M HCl (strong acid) with 0.100 M NaOH (strong base) has an equivalence point of 8.72 pH. The titration of a weak acid with a strong base (or of a weak base with a strong acid) is somewhat more complicated than that just discussed, but it follows the same general principles. Let us consider the titration of 25.0 mL of 0.100 M acetic acid (a weak acid) with 0.100 M sodium hydroxide and compare the titration curve with that of the strong acid. Table 14.4 Figure 14.21 gives the pH values during the titration, shows the titration curve. Although the initial volume and molarity of the acids are the same, there are important differences between the two titration curves. The titration curve for the weak acid begins at a higher value (less acidic) and maintains higher pH values up to the equivalence point. This is because acetic acid is a weak acid, which is only partially ionized. The pH at the equivalence point is also higher (8.72 rather than 7.00) due to the hydrolysis of acetate, a weak base that raises the pH: −(aq) OH−(aq) CH3 CO2 + H2 O(l) ⇌CH3 CO2 H(l) + After the equivalence point, the two curves are identical because the pH is dependent on the excess of hydroxide ion in both cases.

Answer: 0.00 mL: 2.37; 15.0 mL: 3.92; 25.00 mL: 8.29; 30.0 mL: 12.097 Acid-Base Indicators Certain organic substances change color in dilute solution when the hydronium ion concentration reaches a particular value. For example, phenolphthalein is a colorless substance in any aqueous solution with a hydronium ion 10−9 × concentration greater than 5.0 M (pH < 8.3). In more basic solutions where the hydronium ion concentration 10−9 × is less than 5.0 M (pH > 8.3), it is red or pink. Substances such as phenolphthalein, which can be used to determine the pH of a solution, are called acid-base indicators. Acid-base indicators are either weak organic acids or weak organic bases. The equilibrium in a solution of the acid-base indicator methyl orange, a weak acid, can be represented by an equation in which we use HIn as a simple representation for the complex methyl orange molecule: O+(aq) In−(aq) HIn(aq) + H2 O(l) ⇌ H3 + red yellow O+][In−] [H3 10−4 Ka = = 4.0 × [HIn]

836 Chapter 14 | Acid-Base Equilibria In−, The anion of methyl orange, is yellow, and the nonionized form, HIn, is red. When we add acid to a solution of methyl orange, the increased hydronium ion concentration shifts the equilibrium toward the nonionized red form, in accordance with Le Châtelier’s principle. If we add base, we shift the equilibrium towards the yellow form. This behavior is completely analogous to the action of buffers. In−and An indicator’s color is the visible result of the ratio of the concentrations of the two species HIn. If most of In−, In−ion, the indicator (typically about 60−90% or more) is present as then we see the color of the which would be yellow for methyl orange. If most is present as HIn, then we see the color of the HIn molecule: red for methyl orange. For methyl orange, we can rearrange the equation for Ka and write: [In−] [substance with yellow color] Ka = = O+] [HIn] [substance with red color] [H3 [In−] This shows us how the ratio of varies with the concentration of hydronium ion. [HIn] The above expression describing the indicator equilibrium can be rearranged: O+] [H3 [HIn] = [In−] Ka log⎛ ⎞ log⎛ ⎞ O+] [H3 [HIn] ⎝ ⎠= ⎝ ⎠ [In−] Ka ⎞ −log⎛ [In−] log⎛ O+]⎞ ⎠ ⎝ ⎝[H3 ⎠−log(Ka) = [HIn] −log⎛ ⎞ [In−] ⎝ ⎠ −pH + pKa = [HIn] ⎞ log⎛ log⎛ ⎞ [In−] [base] ⎠ ⎝ ⎝ ⎠or pH = pKa + pH = pKa + [HIn] [acid] The last formula is the same as the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, which can be used to describe the equilibrium of indicators. [H3O+] [In−] When has the same numerical value as Ka, the ratio of to [HIn] is equal to 1, meaning that 50% of (In−), the indicator is present in the red form (HIn) and 50% is in the yellow ionic form and the solution appears 10−4 × orange in color. When the hydronium ion concentration increases to 8 M (a pH of 3.1), the solution turns red. No change in color is visible for any further increase in the hydronium ion concentration (decrease in pH). At a 10−5 × hydronium ion concentration of 4 M (a pH of 4.4), most of the indicator is in the yellow ionic form, and a further decrease in the hydronium ion concentration (increase in pH) does not produce a visible color change. The pH range between 3.1 (red) and 4.4 (yellow) is the color-change interval of methyl orange; the pronounced color change takes place between these pH values. There are many different acid-base indicators that cover a wide range of pH values and can be used to determine the approximate pH of an unknown solution by a process of elimination.

Titration curves help us pick an indicator that will provide a sharp color change at the equivalence point. The best selection would be an indicator that has a color change interval that brackets the pH at the equivalence point of the titration. Figure 14.23. The color change intervals of three indicators are shown in The equivalence points of both the titration of the strong acid and of the weak acid are located in the color-change interval of phenolphthalein. We can use it for titrations of either strong acid with strong base or weak acid with strong base.

838 Chapter 14 | Acid-Base Equilibria Figure 14.23 The graph shows a titration curve for the titration of 25.00 mL of 0.100 M CH3CO2H (weak acid) with 0.100 M NaOH (strong base) and the titration curve for the titration of HCl (strong acid) with NaOH (strong base). The pH ranges for the color change of phenolphthalein, litmus, and methyl orange are indicated by the shaded areas. Litmus is a suitable indicator for the HCl titration because its color change brackets the equivalence point. However, we should not use litmus for the CH3CO2H titration because the pH is within the color-change interval of litmus when only about 12 mL of NaOH has been added, and it does not leave the range until 25 mL has been added. The color change would be very gradual, taking place during the addition of 13 mL of NaOH, making litmus useless as an indicator of the equivalence point. We could use methyl orange for the HCl titration, but it would not give very accurate results: (1) It completes its color change slightly before the equivalence point is reached (but very close to it, so this is not too serious); (2) it changes Figure 14.23 color, as shows, during the addition of nearly 0.5 mL of NaOH, which is not so sharp a color change as that of litmus or phenolphthalein; and (3) it goes from yellow to orange to red, making detection of a precise endpoint Figure 14.23 much more challenging than the colorless to pink change of phenolphthalein. shows us that methyl orange would be completely useless as an indicator for the CH3CO2H titration. Its color change begins after about 1 mL of NaOH has been added and ends when about 8 mL has been added. The color change is completed long before the equivalence point (which occurs when 25.0 mL of NaOH has been added) is reached and hence provides no indication of the equivalence point. We base our choice of indicator on a calculated pH, the pH at the equivalence point. At the equivalence point, equimolar amounts of acid and base have been mixed, and the calculation becomes that of the pH of a solution of the salt resulting from the titration. https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

The compound that accepts the proton is called a Brønsted-Lowry base. The species remaining after a Brønsted-Lowry acid has lost a proton is the conjugate base of the acid. The species formed when a Brønsted-Lowry base gains a proton is the conjugate acid of the base. Thus, an acid-base reaction occurs when a proton is transferred from an https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

Amphiprotic species can act as both proton donors and proton acceptors. Water is the most important H3O+, OH−when amphiprotic species.

Stronger acids form weaker conjugate bases, and weaker acids form stronger conjugate bases. Thus strong acids are completely ionized in aqueous solution because their conjugate bases are weaker bases than water. Weak acids are only partially ionized because their conjugate bases are strong enough to compete successfully with water for possession of protons. Strong bases react with water to quantitatively form hydroxide ions. Weak bases give only small amounts of hydroxide ion. The strengths of the binary acids increase from left to right across a period of the periodic table (CH4 < NH3 < H2O < HF), and they increase down a group (HF < HCl < HBr < HI). The strengths of oxyacids that contain the same central element increase as the oxidation number of the element increases (H2SO3 < H2SO4). The strengths of oxyacids also increase as the electronegativity of the central element increases [H2SeO4 < H2SO4]. 14.4 Hydrolysis of Salt Solutions The characteristic properties of aqueous solutions of Brønsted-Lowry acids are due to the presence of hydronium ions; those of aqueous solutions of Brønsted-Lowry bases are due to the presence of hydroxide ions. The neutralization that occurs when aqueous solutions of acids and bases are combined results from the reaction of the hydronium and hydroxide ions to form water. Some salts formed in neutralization reactions may make the product solutions slightly acidic or slightly basic. Solutions that contain salts or hydrated metal ions have a pH that is determined by the extent of the hydrolysis of the ions in the solution. The pH of the solutions may be calculated using familiar equilibrium techniques, or it may be qualitatively determined to be acidic, basic, or neutral depending on the relative Ka and Kb of the ions involved. 14.5 Polyprotic Acids An acid that contains more than one ionizable proton is a polyprotic acid. The protons of these acids ionize in steps. The differences in the acid ionization constants for the successive ionizations of the protons in a polyprotic acid usually vary by roughly five orders of magnitude. As long as the difference between the successive values of Ka of the acid is greater than about a factor of 20, it is appropriate to break down the calculations of the concentrations of the ions in solution into a series of steps.

842 Chapter 14 | Acid-Base Equilibria 14.6 Buffers A solution containing a mixture of an acid and its conjugate base, or of a base and its conjugate acid, is called a buffer solution. Unlike in the case of an acid, base, or salt solution, the hydronium ion concentration of a buffer solution does not change greatly when a small amount of acid or base is added to the buffer solution. The base (or acid) in the buffer reacts with the added acid (or base). 14.7 Acid-Base Titrations A titration curve is a graph that relates the change in pH of an acidic or basic solution to the volume of added titrant. The characteristics of the titration curve are dependent on the specific solutions being titrated. The pH of the solution at the equivalence point may be greater than, equal to, or less than 7.00. The choice of an indicator for a given titration depends on the expected pH at the equivalence point of the titration, and the range of the color change of the indicator.

Chapter 15 | Equilibria of Other Reaction Classes 855 Chapter 15 Equilibria of Other Reaction Classes Figure 15.1 The mineral fluorite (CaF2) is deposited through a precipitation process. Note that pure fluorite is colorless, and that the color in this sample is due to the presence of other metals in the crystal. Chapter Outline 15.1 Precipitation and Dissolution 15.2 Lewis Acids and Bases 15.3 Multiple Equilibria Introduction Figure 15.1, In we see a close-up image of the mineral fluorite, which is commonly used as a semiprecious stone in many types of jewelry because of its striking appearance. These solid deposits of fluorite are formed through a process called hydrothermal precipitation. In this process, the fluorite remains dissolved in solution, usually in hot water heated by volcanic activity deep below the earth, until conditions arise that allow the mineral to come out of solution and form a deposit. These deposit-forming conditions can include a change in temperature of the solution, availability of new locations to form a deposit such as a rock crevice, contact between the solution and a reactive substance such as certain types of rock, or a combination of any of these factors. We previously learned about aqueous solutions and their importance, as well as about solubility rules. While this gives us a picture of solubility, that picture is not complete if we look at the rules alone. Solubility equilibrium, which we will explore in this chapter, is a more complex topic that allows us to determine the extent to which a slightly soluble Figure 15.1) ionic solid will dissolve, and the conditions under which precipitation (such as the fluorite deposit in will occur.

856 Chapter 15 | Equilibria of Other Reaction Classes 15.1 Precipitation and Dissolution By the end of this section, you will be able to: Write chemical equations and equilibrium expressions representing solubility equilibria • Carry out equilibrium computations involving solubility, equilibrium expressions, and solute • concentrations The preservation of medical laboratory blood samples, mining of sea water for magnesium, formulation of over-the- counter medicines such as Milk of Magnesia and antacids, and treating the presence of hard water in your home’s water supply are just a few of the many tasks that involve controlling the equilibrium between a slightly soluble ionic solid and an aqueous solution of its ions. In some cases, we want to prevent dissolution from occurring. Tooth decay, for example, occurs when the calcium hydroxylapatite, which has the formula Ca5(PO4)3(OH), in our teeth dissolves. The dissolution process is aided when bacteria in our mouths feast on the sugars in our diets to produce lactic acid, which reacts with the hydroxide ions in the calcium hydroxylapatite. Preventing the dissolution prevents the decay. On the other hand, sometimes we want 2−ions CO3 a substance to dissolve. We want the calcium carbonate in a chewable antacid to dissolve because the produced in this process help soothe an upset stomach. In this section, we will find out how we can control the dissolution of a slightly soluble ionic solid by the application of Le Châtelier’s principle. We will also learn how to use the equilibrium constant of the reaction to determine the concentration of ions present in a solution. The Solubility Product Constant (Figure 15.2). Silver chloride is what’s known as a sparingly soluble ionic solid Recall from the solubility rules in Ag+ an earlier chapter that halides of are not normally soluble. However, when we add an excess of solid AgCl to Ag+ Cl– water, it dissolves to a small extent and produces a mixture consisting of a very dilute solution of and ions in equilibrium with undissolved silver chloride: dissolution Ag+(aq) Cl−(aq) + AgCl(s) ⇌ precipitation This equilibrium, like other equilibria, is dynamic; some of the solid AgCl continues to dissolve, but at the same Ag+ Cl– time, and ions in the solution combine to produce an equal amount of the solid. At equilibrium, the opposing processes have equal rates. https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

When it is added to water, it dissolves slightly and Ag+ Cl– produces a mixture consisting of a very dilute solution of and ions in equilibrium with undissolved silver chloride. The equilibrium constant for the equilibrium between a slightly soluble ionic solid and a solution of its ions is called the solubility product (Ksp) of the solid. Recall from the chapter on solutions and colloids that we use an ion’s concentration as an approximation of its activity in a dilute solution. For silver chloride, at equilibrium: ⇌Ag+(aq) Cl−(aq) [Ag+(aq)][Cl−(aq)] AgCl(s) + Ksp = When looking at dissolution reactions such as this, the solid is listed as a reactant, whereas the ions are listed as products. The solubility product constant, as with every equilibrium constant expression, is written as the product of the concentrations of each of the ions, raised to the power of their stoichiometric coefficients. Here, the solubility Ag+ Cl– product constant is equal to and when a solution of silver chloride is in equilibrium with undissolved AgCl. There is no denominator representing the reactants in this equilibrium expression since the reactant is a pure solid; therefore [AgCl] does not appear in the expression for Ksp. Table 15.1 Some common solubility products are listed in according to their Ksp values, whereas a more extensive Appendix J. compilation of products appears in Each of these equilibrium constants is much smaller than 1 because the compounds listed are only slightly soluble. A small Ksp represents a system in which the equilibrium lies to the left, so that relatively few hydrated ions would be present in a saturated solution.

Ksp and Solubility Recall that the definition of solubility is the maximum possible concentration of a solute in a solution at a given temperature and pressure. We can determine the solubility product of a slightly soluble solid from that measure of its solubility at a given temperature and pressure, provided that the only significant reaction that occurs when the solid dissolves is its dissociation into solvated ions, that is, the only equilibrium involved is: ⇌pMm+(aq) qXn−(aq) M pXq(s) + In this case, we calculate the solubility product by taking the solid’s solubility expressed in units of moles per liter (mol/L), known as its molar solubility. Example 15.2 Calculation of Ksp from Equilibrium Concentrations (Figure 15.1) We began the chapter with an informal discussion of how the mineral fluorite is formed.

How Sciences Interconnect Using Barium Sulfate for Medical Imaging Various types of medical imaging techniques are used to aid diagnoses of illnesses in a noninvasive manner. One such technique utilizes the ingestion of a barium compound before taking an X-ray image. A suspension 10–10, × of barium sulfate, a chalky powder, is ingested by the patient. Since the Ksp of barium sulfate is 1.1 very little of it dissolves as it coats the lining of the patient’s intestinal tract. Barium-coated areas of the digestive tract then appear on an X-ray as white, allowing for greater visual detail than a traditional X-ray (Figure 15.4). https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

In fluoroscopy, a continuous X- ray is passed through the body so the doctor can monitor, on a TV or computer screen, the barium sulfate’s movement as it passes through the digestive tract. Medical imaging using barium sulfate can be used to diagnose acid reflux disease, Crohn’s disease, and ulcers in addition to other conditions.

A saturated solution in equilibrium with the undissolved solid will result. If the concentrations are such that Q is less than Ksp, then the solution is not saturated and no precipitate will form. Example 15.7 We can compare numerical values of Q with Ksp to predict whether precipitation will occur, as shows. (Note: Since all forms of equilibrium constants are temperature dependent, we will assume a room temperature environment going forward in this chapter unless a different temperature value is explicitly specified.) Example 15.7 Precipitation of Mg(OH)2 The first step in the preparation of magnesium metal is the precipitation of Mg(OH)2 from sea water by the OH– addition of lime, Ca(OH)2, a readily available inexpensive source of ion: 10−13 ⇌Mg2+(aq) 2OH−(aq) Mg(OH)2(s) + Ksp = 2.1 × Mg2+(aq) The concentration of in sea water is 0.0537 M. Will Mg(OH)2 precipitate when enough Ca(OH)2 [OH–] is added to give a of 0.0010 M? Solution This problem asks whether the reaction: ⇌Mg2+(aq) 2OH−(aq) Mg(OH)2(s) + [Mg2+] [OH–] shifts to the left and forms solid Mg(OH)2 when = 0.0537 M and = 0.0010 M.

The solubility product is 1.8 (see AgCl will precipitate if the reaction quotient calculated from the concentrations in the mixture of AgNO3 and NaCl is greater than Ksp.

Thus, if we know the concentration of one of the ions of a slightly soluble ionic solid and the value for the solubility product of the solid, then we can calculate the concentration that the other ion must exceed for precipitation to begin. To simplify the calculation, we will assume that precipitation begins when the reaction quotient becomes equal to the solubility product constant.

Chapter 15 | Equilibria of Other Reaction Classes 869 10–5 × Answer: 7.0 M It is sometimes useful to know the concentration of an ion that remains in solution after precipitation. We can use the solubility product for this calculation too: If we know the value of Ksp and the concentration of one ion in solution, we can calculate the concentration of the second ion remaining in solution. The calculation is of the same Example 15.9—calculation type as that in of the concentration of a species in an equilibrium mixture from the concentrations of the other species and the equilibrium constant. However, the concentrations are different; we are calculating concentrations after precipitation is complete, rather than at the start of precipitation.

Solution The dissolution of Mn(OH)2 is described by the equation: 10−14 ⇌Mn2+(aq) 2OH−(aq) Mn(OH)2(s) + Ksp = 4.5 × OH– Mn2+ 10–6 × We need to calculate the concentration of when the concentration of is 1.8 M.

When the 10–2 10–4), Ksp values of the two compounds differ by two orders of magnitude or more (e.g., vs. almost all of the less soluble compound precipitates before any of the more soluble one does. This is an example of selective precipitation, where a reagent is added to a solution of dissolved ions causing one of the ions to precipitate out before the rest. Chemistry in Everyday Life The Role of Precipitation in Wastewater Treatment Solubility equilibria are useful tools in the treatment of wastewater carried out in facilities that may treat the municipal water in your city or town (Figure 15.6). Specifically, selective precipitation is used to remove contaminants from wastewater before it is released back into natural bodies of water. For example, phosphate 2−) (PO4 are often present in the water discharged from manufacturing facilities. An abundance of ions phosphate causes excess algae to grow, which impacts the amount of oxygen available for marine life as well as making water unsuitable for human consumption. Figure 15.6 Wastewater treatment facilities, such as this one, remove contaminants from wastewater before the water is released back into the natural environment. (credit: “eutrophication&hypoxia”/Wikimedia Commons) One common way to remove phosphates from water is by the addition of calcium hydroxide, known as lime, Ca(OH)2. The lime is converted into calcium carbonate, a strong base, in the water. As the water is made more basic, the calcium ions react with phosphate ions to produce hydroxylapatite, Ca5(PO4)3(OH), which then precipitates out of the solution: https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

We can explain this effect using Le Châtelier’s principle. The addition of acetate ions causes the equilibrium to shift to the left, decreasing the O+ H3 concentration of to compensate for the increased acetate ion concentration. This increases the concentration of CH3CO2H: O+ − CH3 CO2 H + H2 O ⇌H3 + CH3 CO2 Because sodium acetate and acetic acid have the acetate ion in common, the influence on the equilibrium is called the common ion effect. The common ion effect can also have a direct effect on solubility equilibria. Suppose we are looking at the reaction where silver iodide is dissolved: I−(aq) ⇌Ag+(aq) + AgI(s) If we were to add potassium iodide (KI) to this solution, we would be adding a substance that shares a common ion with silver iodide. Le Châtelier’s principle tells us that when a change is made to a system at equilibrium, the reaction will shift to counteract that change. In this example, there would be an excess of iodide ions, so the reaction would shift toward the left, causing more silver iodide to precipitate out of solution.

The Ksp of CdS is 1.0 Solution The first thing you should notice is that the cadmium sulfide is dissolved in a solution that contains cadmium ions. We need to use an ICE table to set up this problem and include the CdBr2 concentration as a contributor of cadmium ions: ⇌Cd2+(aq) S2−(aq) CdS(s) + [Cd2+][S2−] 10−28 Ksp = = 1.0 × 10−28 (0.010 + x)(x) = 1.0 × 10−28 x2 + 0.010x −1.0 × = 0 We can solve this equation using the quadratic formula, but we can also make an assumption to make this calculation much simpler. Since the Ksp value is so small compared with the cadmium concentration, we can assume that the change between the initial concentration and the equilibrium concentration is negligible, so that 0.010 + x ~ 0.010. Going back to our Ksp expression, we would now get: 10−28 [Cd2+][S2−] Ksp = = 1.0 × 10−28 (0.010)(x) = 1.0 × 10−26 x = 1.0 × 10–26 × Therefore, the molar solubility of CdS in this solution is 1.0 M.

N. Lewis proposed a generalized definition of acid-base behavior in which acids and bases are identified by their ability to accept or to donate a pair of electrons and form a coordinate covalent bond. 

--- Page 882 ---
874 Chapter 15 | Equilibria of Other Reaction Classes A coordinate covalent bond (or dative bond) occurs when one of the atoms in the bond provides both bonding electrons. For example, a coordinate covalent bond occurs when a water molecule combines with a hydrogen ion to form a hydronium ion. A coordinate covalent bond also results when an ammonia molecule combines with a hydrogen ion to form an ammonium ion. Both of these equations are shown here. A Lewis acid is any species (molecule or ion) that can accept a pair of electrons, and a Lewis base is any species (molecule or ion) that can donate a pair of electrons. A Lewis acid-base reaction occurs when a base donates a pair of electrons to an acid. A Lewis acid-base adduct, a compound that contains a coordinate covalent bond between the Lewis acid and the Lewis base, is formed. The following equations illustrate the general application of the Lewis concept. The boron atom in boron trifluoride, BF3, has only six electrons in its valence shell. Being short of the preferred octet, BF3 is a very good Lewis acid and reacts with many Lewis bases; a fluoride ion is the Lewis base in this reaction, donating one of its lone pairs: In the following reaction, each of two ammonia molecules, Lewis bases, donates a pair of electrons to a silver ion, the Lewis acid: Nonmetal oxides act as Lewis acids and react with oxide ions, Lewis bases, to form oxyanions: Many Lewis acid-base reactions are displacement reactions in which one Lewis base displaces another Lewis base from an acid-base adduct, or in which one Lewis acid displaces another Lewis acid: https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at 

--- Page 883 ---
Chapter 15 | Equilibria of Other Reaction Classes 875 The last displacement reaction shows how the reaction of a Brønsted-Lowry acid with a base fits into the Lewis concept. A Brønsted-Lowry acid such as HCl is an acid-base adduct according to the Lewis concept, and proton transfer occurs because a more stable acid-base adduct is formed. Thus, although the definitions of acids and bases in the two theories are quite different, the theories overlap considerably. Many slightly soluble ionic solids dissolve when the concentration of the metal ion in solution is decreased through the formation of complex (polyatomic) ions in a Lewis acid-base reaction. For example, silver chloride dissolves in a +. Ag(NH3)2 solution of ammonia because the silver ion reacts with ammonia to form the complex ion The Lewis + Ag(NH3)2 ion is: structure of the The equations for the dissolution of AgCl in a solution of NH3 are: ⟶Ag+(aq) Cl−(aq) AgCl(s) + Ag+(aq) +(aq) + 2NH3(aq) ⟶Ag(NH3)2 +(aq) Cl−(aq) Net: AgCl(s) + 2NH3(aq) ⟶Ag(NH3)2 + Aluminum hydroxide dissolves in a solution of sodium hydroxide or another strong base because of the formation of −. −ion Al(OH)4 Al(OH)4 the complex ion The Lewis structure of the is: The equations for the dissolution are:

These ligands can be neutral molecules like H2O or NH3, or ions such as or Often, the ligands act as Lewis bases, donating a pair of electrons to the central atom. The ligands aggregate themselves around the central atom, creating a new ion with a charge equal to the sum of the charges and, most often, a transitional metal ion. This more complex arrangement is why the resulting ion is called a complex ion. The complex ion formed in these reactions cannot be predicted; it must be determined experimentally. The types of bonds formed in complex ions are called coordinate covalent bonds, as electrons from the ligands are being shared with the central atom. Because of this, complex ions are sometimes referred to as coordination complexes. This will be studied further in upcoming chapters. The equilibrium constant for the reaction of the components of a complex ion to form the complex ion in solution is − Cu(CN)2 called a formation constant (Kf) (sometimes called a stability constant). For example, the complex ion is shown here: It forms by the reaction: Cu+(aq) 2CN−(aq) −(aq) + ⇌Cu(CN)2 At equilibrium: −] [Cu(CN)2 Kf = Q = [Cu+][CN−]2 The inverse of the formation constant is the dissociation constant (Kd), the equilibrium constant for the decomposition of a complex ion into its components in solution.

Chapter 15 | Equilibria of Other Reaction Classes 877 As an example of dissolution by complex ion formation, let us consider what happens when we add aqueous ammonia to a mixture of silver chloride and water. Silver chloride dissolves slightly in water, giving a small concentration of Ag+ ([Ag+] 10–5 × = 1.3 M): ⇌Ag+(aq) Cl−(aq) AgCl(s) + +, Ag(NH3)2 However, if NH3 is present in the water, the complex ion, can form according to the equation: +(aq) Ag+(aq) + 2NH3(aq) ⇌Ag(NH3)2 with +] [Ag(NH3)2 107 Kf = = 1.6 × [Ag+][NH3]2 The large size of this formation constant indicates that most of the free silver ions produced by the dissolution of +. [Ag+], Ag(NH3)2 AgCl combine with NH3 to form As a consequence, the concentration of silver ions, is reduced, [Ag+][Cl–], falls below the solubility product of AgCl: and the reaction quotient for the dissolution of silver chloride, [Ag+][Cl−] Q = < Ksp More silver chloride then dissolves. If the concentration of ammonia is great enough, all of the silver chloride dissolves.

Chapter 15 | Equilibria of Other Reaction Classes 879 There are times when one equilibrium reaction does not adequately describe the system being studied. Sometimes we have more than one type of equilibrium occurring at once (for example, an acid-base reaction and a precipitation reaction). The ocean is a unique example of a system with multiple equilibria, or multiple states of solubility equilibria working simultaneously.

The world’s oceans are presently in the midst of a period of intense acidification, believed to have begun in the mid-nineteenth century, and which is now accelerating at a rate faster than any change to oceanic pH in the last 20 million years.

But when coral are unable to adequately build and maintain their calcium carbonite skeletons because of excess ocean acidification, the unhealthy reef (b) is only capable of hosting a small fraction of the species as before, and the local food chain starts to collapse.

This site (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/16coralreef) has detailed information about how ocean acidification specifically affects coral reefs. Slightly soluble solids derived from weak acids generally dissolve in strong acids, unless their solubility products are extremely small. For example, we can dissolve CuCO3, FeS, and Ca3(PO4)2 in HCl because their basic anions react

H2 PO4 to form weak acids (H2CO3, H2S, and The resulting decrease in the concentration of the anion results in a shift of the equilibrium concentrations to the right in accordance with Le Châtelier’s principle. Of particular relevance to us is the dissolution of hydroxylapatite, Ca5(PO4)3OH, in acid. Apatites are a class of (Figure 15.8); calcium phosphate minerals a biological form of hydroxylapatite is found as the principal mineral in the enamel of our teeth. A mixture of hydroxylapatite and water (or saliva) contains an equilibrium mixture of solid 3−, Ca2+, OH– PO4 Ca5(PO4)3OH and dissolved and ions: ⟶5Ca2+(aq) 3−(aq) OH−(aq) Ca5(PO4)3 OH(s) + 3PO4 + Figure 15.8 Crystal of the mineral hydroxylapatite, Ca5(PO4)3OH, is shown here. Pure apatite is white, but like many other minerals, this sample is colored because of the presence of impurities. When exposed to acid, phosphate ions react with hydronium ions to form hydrogen phosphate ions and ultimately, phosphoric acid: O+ 3−(aq) 2−+ + H3 ⟶H2 H2 O PO4 PO4 O+ 2−(aq) −+ PO4 + H3 ⟶H2 PO4 H2 O O+ −+ H2 PO4 H3 ⟶H3 PO4 + H2 O Hydroxide ion reacts to form water: O+ OH−(aq) + H3 ⟶2H2 O These reactions decrease the phosphate and hydroxide ion concentrations, and additional hydroxylapatite dissolves in an acidic solution in accord with Le Châtelier’s principle. Our teeth develop cavities when acid waste produced by bacteria growing on them causes the hydroxylapatite of the enamel to dissolve. Fluoride toothpastes contain sodium OH– fluoride, NaF, or stannous fluoride [more properly named tin(II) fluoride], SnF2. They function by replacing the F– ion in hydroxylapatite with ion, producing fluorapatite, Ca5(PO4)3F: Na+ OH− NaF + Ca5(PO4)3 OH ⇌Ca5(PO4)3 F + + F– OH–. The resulting Ca5(PO4)3F is slightly less soluble than Ca5(PO4)3OH, and is a weaker base than Both of these factors make the fluorapatite more resistant to attack by acids than hydroxylapatite.

Chapter 15 | Equilibria of Other Reaction Classes 881 Chemistry in Everyday Life Role of Fluoride in Preventing Tooth Decay As we saw previously, fluoride ions help protect our teeth by reacting with hydroxylapatite to form fluorapatite, Ca5(PO4)3F. Since it lacks a hydroxide ion, fluorapatite is more resistant to attacks by acids in our mouths and is thus less soluble, protecting our teeth. Scientists discovered that naturally fluorinated water could be beneficial to your teeth, and so it became common practice to add fluoride to drinking water. Toothpastes and mouthwashes also contain amounts of fluoride (Figure 15.9). Figure 15.9 Fluoride, found in many toothpastes, helps prevent tooth decay (credit: Kerry Ceszyk). Unfortunately, excess fluoride can negate its advantages. Natural sources of drinking water in various parts of the world have varying concentrations of fluoride, and places where that concentration is high are prone to certain health risks when there is no other source of drinking water. The most serious side effect of excess fluoride is the bone disease, skeletal fluorosis. When excess fluoride is in the body, it can cause the joints to stiffen and the bones to thicken. It can severely impact mobility and can negatively affect the thyroid gland. Skeletal fluorosis is a condition that over 2.7 million people suffer from across the world. So while fluoride can protect our teeth from decay, the US Environmental Protection Agency sets a maximum level of 4 ppm (4 mg/ L) of fluoride in drinking water in the US. Fluoride levels in water are not regulated in all countries, so fluorosis is a problem in areas with high levels of fluoride in the groundwater. When acid rain attacks limestone or marble, which are calcium carbonates, a reaction occurs that is similar to the acid attack on hydroxylapatite. The hydronium ion from the acid rain combines with the carbonate ion from calcium carbonates and forms the hydrogen carbonate ion, a weak acid: O+(aq) 2−(aq) −(aq) H3 + CO3 ⟶HCO3 + H2 O(l) Calcium hydrogen carbonate, Ca(HCO3)2, is soluble, so limestone and marble objects slowly dissolve in acid rain. If we add calcium carbonate to a concentrated acid, hydronium ion reacts with the carbonate ion according to the equation: 2−(aq) O+(aq) ⟶H2 CO3(aq) + 2H2 O(l) 2H3 + CO3 (Acid rain is usually not sufficiently acidic to cause this reaction; however, laboratory acids are.) The solution may become saturated with the weak electrolyte carbonic acid, which is unstable, and carbon dioxide gas can be evolved: H2 CO3(aq) ⟶CO2(g) + H2 O(l) These reactions decrease the carbonate ion concentration, and additional calcium carbonate dissolves. If enough acid is present, the concentration of carbonate ion is reduced to such a low level that the reaction quotient for the dissolution of calcium carbonate remains less than the solubility product of calcium carbonate, even after all of the calcium carbonate has dissolved.

Dissolution versus Weak Electrolyte Formation We can determine how to shift the concentration of ions in the equilibrium between a slightly soluble solid and a solution of its ions by applying Le Châtelier’s principle. For example, one way to control the concentration of Mn2+, manganese(II) ion, in a solution is to adjust the pH of the solution and, consequently, to manipulate the equilibrium between the slightly soluble solid manganese(II) hydroxide, manganese(II) ion, and hydroxide ion: [Mn2+][OH−]2 ⇌Mn2+(aq) 2OH−(aq) Mn(OH)2(s) + Ksp = This could be important to a laundry because clothing washed in water that has a manganese concentration exceeding 0.1 mg per liter may be stained by the manganese. We can reduce the concentration of manganese by increasing the concentration of hydroxide ion. We could add, for example, a small amount of NaOH or some other base such as the OH– silicates found in many laundry detergents. As the concentration of ion increases, the equilibrium responds by Mn2+ shifting to the left and reducing the concentration of ion while increasing the amount of solid Mn(OH)2 in the equilibrium mixture, as predicted by Le Châtelier’s principle.

888 Chapter 15 | Equilibria of Other Reaction Classes A slightly soluble electrolyte begins to precipitate when the magnitude of the reaction quotient for the dissolution reaction exceeds the magnitude of the solubility product. Precipitation continues until the reaction quotient equals the solubility product. A reagent can be added to a solution of ions to allow one ion to selectively precipitate out of solution. The common ion effect can also play a role in precipitation reactions. In the presence of an ion in common with one of the ions in the solution, Le Châtelier’s principle applies and more precipitate comes out of solution so that the molar solubility is reduced. 15.2 Lewis Acids and Bases G.N. Lewis proposed a definition for acids and bases that relies on an atom’s or molecule’s ability to accept or donate electron pairs. A Lewis acid is a species that can accept an electron pair, whereas a Lewis base has an electron pair available for donation to a Lewis acid. Complex ions are examples of Lewis acid-base adducts. In a complex ion, we have a central atom, often consisting of a transition metal cation, which acts as a Lewis acid, and several neutral molecules or ions surrounding them called ligands that act as Lewis bases. Complex ions form by sharing electron pairs to form coordinate covalent bonds. The equilibrium reaction that occurs when forming a complex ion has an equilibrium constant associated with it called a formation constant, Kf. This is often referred to as a stability constant, as it represents the stability of the complex ion. Formation of complex ions in solution can have a profound effect on the solubility of a transition metal compound. 15.3 Multiple Equilibria Several systems we encounter consist of multiple equilibria, systems where two or more equilibria processes are occurring simultaneously. Some common examples include acid rain, fluoridation, and dissolution of carbon dioxide in sea water. When looking at these systems, we need to consider each equilibrium separately and then combine the individual equilibrium constants into one solubility product or reaction quotient expression using the tools from the first equilibrium chapter. Le Châtelier’s principle also must be considered, as each reaction in a multiple equilibria system will shift toward reactants or products based on what is added to the initial reaction and how it affects each subsequent equilibrium reaction.

This chapter will introduce additional thermodynamic concepts, including those that enable the prediction of any chemical or physical changes under a given set of conditions. 16.1 Spontaneity By the end of this section, you will be able to: Distinguish between spontaneous and nonspontaneous processes • Describe the dispersal of matter and energy that accompanies certain spontaneous processes • In this section, consider the differences between two types of changes in a system: Those that occur spontaneously and those that occur by force. In doing so, we’ll gain an understanding as to why some systems are naturally inclined to change in one direction under certain conditions and how relatively quickly or slowly that natural change proceeds. 

--- Page 910 ---
902 Chapter 16 | Thermodynamics We’ll also gain insight into how the spontaneity of a process affects the distribution of energy and matter within the system. Spontaneous and Nonspontaneous Processes Processes have a natural tendency to occur in one direction under a given set of conditions. Water will naturally flow downhill, but uphill flow requires outside intervention such as the use of a pump. Iron exposed to the earth’s atmosphere will corrode, but rust is not converted to iron without intentional chemical treatment. A spontaneous process is one that occurs naturally under certain conditions. A nonspontaneous process, on the other hand, will not take place unless it is “driven” by the continual input of energy from an external source. A process that is spontaneous in one direction under a particular set of conditions is nonspontaneous in the reverse direction. At room temperature and typical atmospheric pressure, for example, ice will spontaneously melt, but water will not spontaneously freeze. The spontaneity of a process is not correlated to the speed of the process. A spontaneous change may be so rapid that it is essentially instantaneous or so slow that it cannot be observed over any practical period of time. To illustrate this concept, consider the decay of radioactive isotopes, a topic more thoroughly treated in the chapter on nuclear chemistry. Radioactive decay is by definition a spontaneous process in which the nuclei of unstable isotopes emit radiation as they are converted to more stable nuclei. All the decay processes occur spontaneously, but the rates at which different isotopes decay vary widely. Technetium-99m is a popular radioisotope for medical imaging studies that undergoes relatively rapid decay and exhibits a half-life of about six hours. Uranium-238 is the most abundant isotope of uranium, and its decay occurs much more slowly, exhibiting a half-life of more than four billion years (Figure 16.2). Figure 16.2 Both U-238 and Tc-99m undergo spontaneous radioactive decay, but at drastically different rates. Over the course of one week, essentially all of a Tc-99m sample and none of a U-238 sample will have decayed. (Figure 16.3). As another example, consider the conversion of diamond into graphite C(s, diamond) ⟶C(s, graphite) The phase diagram for carbon indicates that graphite is the stable form of this element under ambient atmospheric pressure, while diamond is the stable allotrope at very high pressures, such as those present during its geologic formation. Thermodynamic calculations of the sort described in the last section of this chapter indicate that the conversion of diamond to graphite at ambient pressure occurs spontaneously, yet diamonds are observed to exist, and persist, under these conditions. Though the process is spontaneous under typical ambient conditions, its rate is extremely slow, and so for all practical purposes diamonds are indeed “forever.” Situations such as these emphasize https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

Chapter 16 | Thermodynamics 903 the important distinction between the thermodynamic and the kinetic aspects of a process. In this particular case, diamonds are said to be thermodynamically unstable but kinetically stable under ambient conditions. Figure 16.3 The conversion of carbon from the diamond allotrope to the graphite allotrope is spontaneous at ambient pressure, but its rate is immeasurably slow at low to moderate temperatures. This process is known as graphitization, and its rate can be increased to easily measurable values at temperatures in the 1000–2000 K range.

Initially there is an ideal gas on the left and (Figure 16.4). a vacuum on the right When the valve is opened, the gas spontaneously expands to fill both flasks. Recalling the definition of pressure-volume work from the chapter on thermochemistry, note that no work has been done because the pressure in a vacuum is zero. w = −PΔV = 0 (P = 0 in a vaccum) Note as well that since the system is isolated, no heat has been exchanged with the surroundings (q = 0). The first law of thermodynamics confirms that there has been no change in the system’s internal energy as a result of this process. ΔU = q + w = 0 + 0 = 0 The spontaneity of this process is therefore not a consequence of any change in energy that accompanies the process. Instead, the driving force appears to be related to the greater, more uniform dispersal of matter that results when the gas is allowed to expand. Initially, the system was comprised of one flask containing matter and another flask containing nothing. After the spontaneous process took place, the matter was distributed both more widely (occupying twice its original volume) and more uniformly (present in equal amounts in each flask). 

--- Page 912 ---
904 Chapter 16 | Thermodynamics Figure 16.4 An isolated system consists of an ideal gas in one flask that is connected by a closed valve to a second flask containing a vacuum. Once the valve is opened, the gas spontaneously becomes evenly distributed between the flasks. Now consider two objects at different temperatures: object X at temperature TX and object Y at temperature TY, with (Figure 16.5). TX > TY When these objects come into contact, heat spontaneously flows from the hotter object (X) to the colder one (Y). This corresponds to a loss of thermal energy by X and a gain of thermal energy by Y. qX < 0 and qY = −qX > 0 From the perspective of this two-object system, there was no net gain or loss of thermal energy, rather the available thermal energy was redistributed among the two objects. This spontaneous process resulted in a more uniform dispersal of energy. Figure 16.5 When two objects at different temperatures come in contact, heat spontaneously flows from the hotter to the colder object. As illustrated by the two processes described, an important factor in determining the spontaneity of a process is the extent to which it changes the dispersal or distribution of matter and/or energy. In each case, a spontaneous process took place that resulted in a more uniform distribution of matter or energy. Example 16.1 Redistribution of Matter during a Spontaneous Process Describe how matter is redistributed when the following spontaneous processes take place: (a) A solid sublimes. (b) A gas condenses. (c) A drop of food coloring added to a glass of water forms a solution with uniform color. Solution https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

Chapter 16 | Thermodynamics 905 Figure 16.6 (credit a: modification of work by Jenny Downing; credit b: modification of work by “Fuzzy Gerdes”/Flickr; credit c: modification of work by Sahar Atwa) (a) Sublimation is the conversion of a solid (relatively high density) to a gas (much lesser density). This process yields a much greater dispersal of matter, since the molecules will occupy a much greater volume after the solid-to-gas transition. (b) Condensation is the conversion of a gas (relatively low density) to a liquid (much greater density). This process yields a much lesser dispersal of matter, since the molecules will occupy a much lesser volume after the solid-to-gas transition. (c) The process in question is dilution. The food dye molecules initially occupy a much smaller volume (the drop of dye solution) than they occupy once the process is complete (in the full glass of water). The process therefore entails a greater dispersal of matter. The process may also yield a more uniform dispersal of matter, since the initial state of the system involves two regions of different dye concentrations (high in the drop, zero in the water), and the final state of the system contains a single dye concentration throughout. Check Your Learning Describe how matter and/or energy is redistributed when you empty a canister of compressed air into a room. Answer: This is also a dilution process, analogous to example (c). It entails both a greater and more uniform dispersal of matter as the compressed air in the canister is permitted to expand into the lower-pressure air of the room. 16.2 Entropy By the end of this section, you will be able to: Define entropy • Explain the relationship between entropy and the number of microstates • Predict the sign of the entropy change for chemical and physical processes • (Figure 16.7) In 1824, at the age of 28, Nicolas Léonard Sadi Carnot published the results of an extensive study regarding the efficiency of steam heat engines. In a later review of Carnot’s findings, Rudolf Clausius introduced a new thermodynamic property that relates the spontaneous heat flow accompanying a process to the temperature at which the process takes place. This new property was expressed as the ratio of the reversible heat (qrev) and the kelvin temperature (T). The term reversible process refers to a process that takes place at such a slow rate that it is always at equilibrium and its direction can be changed (it can be “reversed”) by an infinitesimally small change is some 

--- Page 914 ---
906 Chapter 16 | Thermodynamics condition. Note that the idea of a reversible process is a formalism required to support the development of various thermodynamic concepts; no real processes are truly reversible, rather they are classified as irreversible. Figure 16.7 (a) Nicholas Léonard Sadi Carnot’s research into steam-powered machinery and (b) Rudolf Clausius’s later study of those findings led to groundbreaking discoveries about spontaneous heat flow processes. Similar to other thermodynamic properties, this new quantity is a state function, and so its change depends only upon the initial and final states of a system. In 1865, Clausius named this property entropy (S) and defined its change for any process as the following: qrev ΔS = T The entropy change for a real, irreversible process is then equal to that for the theoretical reversible process that involves the same initial and final states. Entropy and Microstates Following the work of Carnot and Clausius, Ludwig Boltzmann developed a molecular-scale statistical model that related the entropy of a system to the number of microstates possible for the system. A microstate (W) is a specific configuration of the locations and energies of the atoms or molecules that comprise a system like the following: S = k ln W 10−23 × Here k is the Boltzmann constant and has a value of 1.38 J/K. As for other state functions, the change in entropy for a process is the difference between its final (Sf) and initial (Si) values: Wf ΔS = Sf −Si = k ln Wf −k ln Wi = k ln Wi For processes involving an increase in the number of microstates, Wf > Wi, the entropy of the system increases, ΔS > 0. Conversely, processes that reduce the number of microstates, Wf < Wi, yield a decrease in system entropy, ΔS < 0. This molecular-scale interpretation of entropy provides a link to the probability that a process will occur as illustrated in the next paragraphs. https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

Chapter 16 | Thermodynamics 907 Consider the general case of a system comprised of N particles distributed among n boxes. The number of microstates nN. 24 possible for such a system is For example, distributing four particles among two boxes will result in Figure 16.8. = 16 different microstates as illustrated in Microstates with equivalent particle arrangements (not considering individual particle identities) are grouped together and are called distributions. The probability that a system will exist with its components in a given distribution is proportional to the number of microstates within the distribution. Since entropy increases logarithmically with the number of microstates, the most probable distribution is therefore the one of greatest entropy. Figure 16.8 The sixteen microstates associated with placing four particles in two boxes are shown. The microstates are collected into five distributions—(a), (b), (c), (d), and (e)—based on the numbers of particles in each box. For this system, the most probable configuration is one of the six microstates associated with distribution (c) where the particles are evenly distributed between the boxes, that is, a configuration of two particles in each box. The 6 3 8. probability of finding the system in this configuration is or or The least probable configuration of the system 16 is one in which all four particles are in one box, corresponding to distributions (a) and (d), each with a probability of ⎛ ⎞ ⎝1 2 1 1 ⎠= 16. + The probability of finding all particles in only one box (either the left box or right box) is then 16 16 16 1 8. or (2N). As you add more particles to the system, the number of possible microstates increases exponentially A 1023), macroscopic (laboratory-sized) system would typically consist of moles of particles (N ~ and the corresponding number of microstates would be staggeringly huge. Regardless of the number of particles in the system, however, the distributions in which roughly equal numbers of particles are found in each box are always the most probable configurations. (Figure 16.4) The previous description of an ideal gas expanding into a vacuum is a macroscopic example of this particle-in-a-box model. For this system, the most probable distribution is confirmed to be the one in which the matter is most uniformly dispersed or distributed between the two flasks. The spontaneous process whereby the gas contained initially in one flask expands to fill both flasks equally therefore yields an increase in entropy for the system. A similar approach may be used to describe the spontaneous flow of heat. Consider a system consisting of two Figure 16.9. objects, each containing two particles, and two units of energy (represented as “*”) in The hot object is 

--- Page 916 ---
908 Chapter 16 | Thermodynamics comprised of particles A and B and initially contains both energy units. The cold object is comprised of particles C and D, which initially has no energy units. Distribution (a) shows the three microstates possible for the initial state of the system, with both units of energy contained within the hot object. If one of the two energy units is transferred, the result is distribution (b) consisting of four microstates. If both energy units are transferred, the result is distribution (c) consisting of three microstates. And so, we may describe this system by a total of ten microstates. The probability that the heat does not flow when the two objects are brought into contact, that is, that the system remains in distribution 3 10. (a), is More likely is the flow of heat to yield one of the other two distribution, the combined probability being 7 10. The most likely result is the flow of heat to yield the uniform dispersal of energy represented by distribution (b), 4 10. the probability of this configuration being As for the previous example of matter dispersal, extrapolating this treatment to macroscopic collections of particles dramatically increases the probability of the uniform distribution relative to the other distributions. This supports the common observation that placing hot and cold objects in contact results in spontaneous heat flow that ultimately equalizes the objects’ temperatures. And, again, this spontaneous process is also characterized by an increase in system entropy. Figure 16.9 This shows a microstate model describing the flow of heat from a hot object to a cold object. (a) Before the heat flow occurs, the object comprised of particles A and B contains both units of energy and as represented by a distribution of three microstates. (b) If the heat flow results in an even dispersal of energy (one energy unit transferred), a distribution of four microstates results. (c) If both energy units are transferred, the resulting distribution has three microstates. Example 16.2 Determination of ΔS Consider the system shown here. What is the change in entropy for a process that converts the system from distribution (a) to (c)? Solution We are interested in the following change: The initial number of microstates is one, the final six: Wc 6 10−23 10−23 ΔS = k ln = 1.38 × J/K × ln = 2.47 × J/K Wa 1 https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

Chapter 16 | Thermodynamics 909 The sign of this result is consistent with expectation; since there are more microstates possible for the final state than for the initial state, the change in entropy should be positive. Check Your Learning Figure 16.9. Consider the system shown in What is the change in entropy for the process where all the energy is transferred from the hot object (AB) to the cold object (CD)? Answer: 0 J/K Predicting the Sign of ΔS The relationships between entropy, microstates, and matter/energy dispersal described previously allow us to make generalizations regarding the relative entropies of substances and to predict the sign of entropy changes for chemical Figure 16.10. and physical processes. Consider the phase changes illustrated in In the solid phase, the atoms or molecules are restricted to nearly fixed positions with respect to each other and are capable of only modest oscillations about these positions. With essentially fixed locations for the system’s component particles, the number of microstates is relatively small. In the liquid phase, the atoms or molecules are free to move over and around each other, though they remain in relatively close proximity to one another. This increased freedom of motion results in a greater variation in possible particle locations, so the number of microstates is correspondingly greater than for the solid. As a result, Sliquid > Ssolid and the process of converting a substance from solid to liquid (melting) is characterized by an increase in entropy, ΔS > 0. By the same logic, the reciprocal process (freezing) exhibits a decrease in entropy, ΔS < 0. Figure 16.10 The entropy of a substance increases (ΔS > 0) as it transforms from a relatively ordered solid, to a less-ordered liquid, and then to a still less-ordered gas. The entropy decreases (ΔS < 0) as the substance transforms from a gas to a liquid and then to a solid. Now consider the vapor or gas phase. The atoms or molecules occupy a much greater volume than in the liquid phase; therefore each atom or molecule can be found in many more locations than in the liquid (or solid) phase. Consequently, for any substance, Sgas > Sliquid > Ssolid, and the processes of vaporization and sublimation likewise involve increases in entropy, ΔS > 0. Likewise, the reciprocal phase transitions, condensation and deposition, involve decreases in entropy, ΔS < 0.

910 Chapter 16 | Thermodynamics According to kinetic-molecular theory, the temperature of a substance is proportional to the average kinetic energy of its particles. Raising the temperature of a substance will result in more extensive vibrations of the particles in solids and more rapid translations of the particles in liquids and gases. At higher temperatures, the distribution of kinetic energies among the atoms or molecules of the substance is also broader (more dispersed) than at lower temperatures. (Figure 16.11). Thus, the entropy for any substance increases with temperature Figure 16.11 Entropy increases as the temperature of a substance is raised, which corresponds to the greater spread of kinetic energies. When a substance melts or vaporizes, it experiences a significant increase in entropy. Link to Learning Try this simulator (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/16freemotion) with interactive visualization of the dependence of particle location and freedom of motion on physical state and temperature. The entropy of a substance is influenced by structure of the particles (atoms or molecules) that comprise the substance. With regard to atomic substances, heavier atoms possess greater entropy at a given temperature than lighter atoms, which is a consequence of the relation between a particle’s mass and the spacing of quantized translational energy levels (which is a topic beyond the scope of our treatment). For molecules, greater numbers of atoms (regardless of their masses) increase the ways in which the molecules can vibrate and thus the number of possible microstates and the system entropy. Finally, variations in the types of particles affects the entropy of a system. Compared to a pure substance, in which all particles are identical, the entropy of a mixture of two or more different particle types is greater. This is because of the additional orientations and interactions that are possible in a system comprised of nonidentical components. For example, when a solid dissolves in a liquid, the particles of the solid experience both a greater freedom of motion and additional interactions with the solvent particles. This corresponds to a more uniform dispersal of matter and energy and a greater number of microstates. The process of dissolution therefore involves an increase in entropy, ΔS > 0. Considering the various factors that affect entropy allows us to make informed predictions of the sign of ΔS for Example 16.3. various chemical and physical processes as illustrated in Example 16.3 https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

Processes that involve an increase in entropy of the system (ΔS > 0) are very often spontaneous; however, examples to the contrary are plentiful. By expanding consideration of entropy changes to include the surroundings, we may reach a significant conclusion regarding the relation between this property and spontaneity. In thermodynamic models, the system and surroundings comprise everything, that is, the universe, and so the following is true: ΔSuniv = ΔSsys + ΔSsurr To illustrate this relation, consider again the process of heat flow between two objects, one identified as the system and the other as the surroundings. There are three possibilities for such a process: 

--- Page 920 ---
912 Chapter 16 | Thermodynamics The objects are at different temperatures, and heat flows from the hotter to the cooler object. This is always 1. observed to occur spontaneously. Designating the hotter object as the system and invoking the definition of entropy yields the following: −qrev qrev ΔSsys = and ΔSsurr = Tsys Tsurr The arithmetic signs of qrev denote the loss of heat by the system and the gain of heat by the surroundings. Since Tsys > Tsurr in this scenario, the magnitude of the entropy change for the surroundings will be greater than that for the system, and so the sum of ΔSsys and ΔSsurr will yield a positive value for ΔSuniv. This process involves an increase in the entropy of the universe. The objects are at different temperatures, and heat flows from the cooler to the hotter object. This is never 2. observed to occur spontaneously. Again designating the hotter object as the system and invoking the definition of entropy yields the following: qrev −qrev ΔSsys = and ΔSsurr = Tsys Tsurr The arithmetic signs of qrev denote the gain of heat by the system and the loss of heat by the surroundings. The magnitude of the entropy change for the surroundings will again be greater than that for the system, but in this case, the signs of the heat changes will yield a negative value for ΔSuniv. This process involves a decrease in the entropy of the universe. The temperature difference between the objects is infinitesimally small, Tsys ≈Tsurr, and so the heat flow 3. is thermodynamically reversible. See the previous section’s discussion). In this case, the system and surroundings experience entropy changes that are equal in magnitude and therefore sum to yield a value of zero for ΔSuniv. This process involves no change in the entropy of the universe. These results lead to a profound statement regarding the relation between entropy and spontaneity known as the second law of thermodynamics: all spontaneous changes cause an increase in the entropy of the universe. A Table 16.1. summary of these three relations is provided in The Second Law of Thermodynamics ΔSuniv > 0 spontaneous ΔSuniv < 0 nonspontaneous (spontaneous in opposite direction) ΔSuniv = 0 reversible (system is at equilibrium) Table 16.1 For many realistic applications, the surroundings are vast in comparison to the system. In such cases, the heat gained or lost by the surroundings as a result of some process represents a very small, nearly infinitesimal, fraction of its total thermal energy. For example, combustion of a fuel in air involves transfer of heat from a system (the fuel and oxygen molecules undergoing reaction) to surroundings that are infinitely more massive (the earth’s atmosphere). As a result, qsurr is a good approximation of qrev, and the second law may be stated as the following: qsurr ΔSuniv = ΔSsys + ΔSsurr = ΔSsys + T Example 16.4. We may use this equation to predict the spontaneity of a process as illustrated in Example 16.4 https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

Chapter 16 | Thermodynamics 913 Will Ice Spontaneously Melt? The entropy change for the process O(l) H2 O(s) ⟶H2 is 22.1 J/K and requires that the surroundings transfer 6.00 kJ of heat to the system. Is the process spontaneous at −10.00 °C? Is it spontaneous at +10.00 °C? Solution We can assess the spontaneity of the process by calculating the entropy change of the universe. If ΔSuniv is positive, then the process is spontaneous. At both temperatures, ΔSsys = 22.1 J/K and qsurr = −6.00 kJ. At −10.00 °C (263.15 K), the following is true: qsurr ΔSuniv = ΔSsys + ΔSsurr = ΔSsys + T 103 −6.00 × J = 22.1 J/K + = −0.7 J/K 263.15 K Suniv < 0, so melting is nonspontaneous (not spontaneous) at −10.0 °C. At 10.00 °C (283.15 K), the following is true: qsurr ΔSuniv = ΔSsys + T 103 −6.00 × J = 22.1 J/K + = +0.9 J/K 283.15 K Suniv > 0, so melting is spontaneous at 10.00 °C. Check Your Learning Using this information, determine if liquid water will spontaneously freeze at the same temperatures. What can you say about the values of Suniv? Answer: Entropy is a state function, and freezing is the opposite of melting. At −10.00 °C spontaneous, +0.7 J/K; at +10.00 °C nonspontaneous, −0.9 J/K. The Third Law of Thermodynamics The previous section described the various contributions of matter and energy dispersal that contribute to the entropy of a system. With these contributions in mind, consider the entropy of a pure, perfectly crystalline solid possessing no kinetic energy (that is, at a temperature of absolute zero, 0 K). This system may be described by a single microstate, as its purity, perfect crystallinity and complete lack of motion means there is but one possible location for each identical atom or molecule comprising the crystal (W = 1). According to the Boltzmann equation, the entropy of this system is zero. S = k ln W = k ln(1) = 0 This limiting condition for a system’s entropy represents the third law of thermodynamics: the entropy of a pure, perfect crystalline substance at 0 K is zero. We can make careful calorimetric measurements to determine the temperature dependence of a substance’s entropy S298 ° for and to derive absolute entropy values under specific conditions. Standard entropies are given the label values determined for one mole of substance at a pressure of 1 bar and a temperature of 298 K. The standard entropy change (ΔS°) for any process may be computed from the standard entropies of its reactant and product species like the following:

916 Chapter 16 | Thermodynamics 16.4 Free Energy By the end of this section, you will be able to: Define Gibbs free energy, and describe its relation to spontaneity • Calculate free energy change for a process using free energies of formation for its reactants and • products Calculate free energy change for a process using enthalpies of formation and the entropies for its • reactants and products Explain how temperature affects the spontaneity of some processes • Relate standard free energy changes to equilibrium constants • One of the challenges of using the second law of thermodynamics to determine if a process is spontaneous is that we must determine the entropy change for the system and the entropy change for the surroundings. An alternative approach involving a new thermodynamic property defined in terms of system properties only was introduced in the late nineteenth century by American mathematician Josiah Willard Gibbs. This new property is called the Gibbs free energy change (G) (or simply the free energy), and it is defined in terms of a system’s enthalpy and entropy as the following: G = H −TS Free energy is a state function, and at constant temperature and pressure, the standard free energy change (ΔG°) may be expressed as the following: ΔG = ΔH −TΔS (For simplicity’s sake, the subscript “sys” will be omitted henceforth.) We can understand the relationship between this system property and the spontaneity of a process by recalling the previously derived second law expression: qsurr ΔSuniv = ΔS + T The first law requires that qsurr = −qsys, and at constant pressure qsys = ΔH, and so this expression may be rewritten as the following: −ΔH ΔSuniv = ΔS T ΔH is the enthalpy change of the system. Multiplying both sides of this equation by −T, and rearranging yields the following: −TΔSuniv = ΔH −TΔS Comparing this equation to the previous one for free energy change shows the following relation: ΔG = −TΔSuniv The free energy change is therefore a reliable indicator of the spontaneity of a process, being directly related to the Table 16.3 previously identified spontaneity indicator, ΔSuniv. summarizes the relation between the spontaneity of a process and the arithmetic signs of these indicators. https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

A convenient and common approach to the calculation of free energy changes for physical and chemical reactions is by use of widely available compilations of standard state thermodynamic data. One method involves the use of standard enthalpies and entropies to compute standard free energy changes according to Example 16.7. the following relation as demonstrated in ΔG° = ΔH° −TΔS° Example 16.7 Evaluation of ΔG° Change from ΔH° and ΔS° Appendix G Use standard enthalpy and entropy data from to calculate the standard free energy change for the vaporization of water at room temperature (298 K).

C2 H4(g) ⟶H2(g) + C2 H2(g) Answer: −141.5 kJ/mol, nonspontaneous Temperature Dependence of Spontaneity As was previously demonstrated in this chapter’s section on entropy, the spontaneity of a process may depend upon the temperature of the system. Phase transitions, for example, will proceed spontaneously in one direction or the other depending upon the temperature of the substance in question. Likewise, some chemical reactions can also exhibit temperature dependent spontaneities. To illustrate this concept, the equation relating free energy change to the enthalpy and entropy changes for the process is considered: ΔG = ΔH −TΔS 

--- Page 928 ---
920 Chapter 16 | Thermodynamics The spontaneity of a process, as reflected in the arithmetic sign of its free energy change, is then determined by the signs of the enthalpy and entropy changes and, in some cases, the absolute temperature. Since T is the absolute (kelvin) temperature, it can only have positive values. Four possibilities therefore exist with regard to the signs of the enthalpy and entropy changes: Both ΔH and ΔS are positive. This condition describes an endothermic process that involves an increase 1. in system entropy. In this case, ΔG will be negative if the magnitude of the TΔS term is greater than ΔH. If the TΔS term is less than ΔH, the free energy change will be positive. Such a process is spontaneous at high temperatures and nonspontaneous at low temperatures. Both ΔH and ΔS are negative. This condition describes an exothermic process that involves a decrease in 2. system entropy. In this case, ΔG will be negative if the magnitude of the TΔS term is less than ΔH. If the TΔS term’s magnitude is greater than ΔH, the free energy change will be positive. Such a process is spontaneous at low temperatures and nonspontaneous at high temperatures. ΔH is positive and ΔS is negative. This condition describes an endothermic process that involves a decrease 3. in system entropy. In this case, ΔG will be positive regardless of the temperature. Such a process is nonspontaneous at all temperatures. ΔH is negative and ΔS is positive. This condition describes an exothermic process that involves an increase in 4. system entropy. In this case, ΔG will be negative regardless of the temperature. Such a process is spontaneous at all temperatures. Figure 16.12. These four scenarios are summarized in Figure 16.12 There are four possibilities regarding the signs of enthalpy and entropy changes. Example 16.9 Predicting the Temperature Dependence of Spontaneity The incomplete combustion of carbon is described by the following equation: 2C(s) + O2(g) ⟶2CO(g) How does the spontaneity of this process depend upon temperature?

--- Page 929 ---
Chapter 16 | Thermodynamics 921 Combustion processes are exothermic (ΔH < 0). This particular reaction involves an increase in entropy due to the accompanying increase in the amount of gaseous species (net gain of one mole of gas, ΔS > 0). The reaction is therefore spontaneous (ΔG < 0) at all temperatures. Check Your Learning Popular chemical hand warmers generate heat by the air-oxidation of iron: 3O2(g) ⟶2Fe2 O3(s) 4Fe(s) + How does the spontaneity of this process depend upon temperature? Answer: ΔH and ΔS are negative; the reaction is spontaneous at low temperatures. When considering the conclusions drawn regarding the temperature dependence of spontaneity, it is important to keep in mind what the terms “high” and “low” mean. Since these terms are adjectives, the temperatures in question are deemed high or low relative to some reference temperature. A process that is nonspontaneous at one temperature but spontaneous at another will necessarily undergo a change in “spontaneity” (as reflected by its ΔG) as temperature varies. This is clearly illustrated by a graphical presentation of the free energy change equation, in which ΔG is plotted on the y axis versus T on the x axis: ΔG = ΔH −TΔS y = b + mx Figure 16.13. Such a plot is shown in A process whose enthalpy and entropy changes are of the same arithmetic sign will exhibit a temperature-dependent spontaneity as depicted by the two yellow lines in the plot. Each line crosses from one spontaneity domain (positive or negative ΔG) to the other at a temperature that is characteristic of the process in question. This temperature is represented by the x-intercept of the line, that is, the value of T for which ΔG is zero: ΔG = 0 = ΔH −TΔS ΔH T = ΔS And so, saying a process is spontaneous at “high” or “low” temperatures means the temperature is above or below, respectively, that temperature at which ΔG for the process is zero. As noted earlier, this condition describes a system at equilibrium.

Check Your Learning Appendix G Use the information in to estimate the boiling point of CS2. Answer: 313 K (accepted value 319 K) Free Energy and Equilibrium The free energy change for a process may be viewed as a measure of its driving force. A negative value for ΔG represents a finite driving force for the process in the forward direction, while a positive value represents a driving force for the process in the reverse direction. When ΔG is zero, the forward and reverse driving forces are equal, and so the process occurs in both directions at the same rate (the system is at equilibrium). In the chapter on equilibrium the reaction quotient, Q, was introduced as a convenient measure of the status of an equilibrium system. Recall that Q is the numerical value of the mass action expression for the system, and that you may use its value to identify the direction in which a reaction will proceed in order to achieve equilibrium. When Q is lesser than the equilibrium constant, K, the reaction will proceed in the forward direction until equilibrium is reached and Q = K. Conversely, if Q < K, the process will proceed in the reverse direction until equilibrium is achieved. The free energy change for a process taking place with reactants and products present under nonstandard conditions, ΔG, is related to the standard free energy change, ΔG°, according to this equation: ΔG = ΔG° + RT ln Q R is the gas constant (8.314 J/K mol), T is the kelvin or absolute temperature, and Q is the reaction quotient. We may Example use this equation to predict the spontaneity for a process under any given set of conditions as illustrated in 16.11. Example 16.11 Calculating ΔG under Nonstandard Conditions What is the free energy change for the process shown here under the specified conditions? PN2 = 0.870 atm, PH2 = 0.250 atm, PNH3 = 12.9 atm T = 25 °C, and 2NH3(g) ⟶3H2(g) + N2(g) ΔG° = 33.0 kJ/mol Solution The equation relating free energy change to standard free energy change and reaction quotient may be used directly: ⎞ ⎛ ⎛ ⎝0.2503⎞ ⎠× 0.870 ⎟= ⎜8.314 J kJ J 9680 ΔG = ΔG° + RT ln Q = 33.0 + × 298 K × ln or 9.68 kJ/mol ⎠ ⎝ mol mol mol K 12.92 Since the computed value for ΔG is positive, the reaction is nonspontaneous under these conditions.

928 Chapter 16 | Thermodynamics Summary 16.1 Spontaneity Chemical and physical processes have a natural tendency to occur in one direction under certain conditions. A spontaneous process occurs without the need for a continual input of energy from some external source, while a nonspontaneous process requires such. Systems undergoing a spontaneous process may or may not experience a gain or loss of energy, but they will experience a change in the way matter and/or energy is distributed within the system. 16.2 Entropy Entropy (S) is a state function that can be related to the number of microstates for a system (the number of ways the system can be arranged) and to the ratio of reversible heat to kelvin temperature. It may be interpreted as a measure of the dispersal or distribution of matter and/or energy in a system, and it is often described as representing the “disorder” of the system. For a given substance, Ssolid < Sliquid < Sgas in a given physical state at a given temperature, entropy is typically greater for heavier atoms or more complex molecules. Entropy increases when a system is heated and when solutions form. Using these guidelines, the sign of entropy changes for some chemical reactions may be reliably predicted. 16.3 The Second and Third Laws of Thermodynamics The second law of thermodynamics states that a spontaneous process increases the entropy of the universe, Suniv > 0. If ΔSuniv < 0, the process is nonspontaneous, and if ΔSuniv = 0, the system is at equilibrium. The third law of thermodynamics establishes the zero for entropy as that of a perfect, pure crystalline solid at 0 K. With only one possible microstate, the entropy is zero. We may compute the standard entropy change for a process by using standard entropy values for the reactants and products involved in the process. 16.4 Free Energy Gibbs free energy (G) is a state function defined with regard to system quantities only and may be used to predict the spontaneity of a process. A negative value for ΔG indicates a spontaneous process; a positive ΔG indicates a nonspontaneous process; and a ΔG of zero indicates that the system is at equilibrium. A number of approaches to the computation of free energy changes are possible. Exercises 16.1 Spontaneity 1. What is a spontaneous reaction? 2. What is a nonspontaneous reaction? 3. Indicate whether the following processes are spontaneous or nonspontaneous.

A helium-filled balloon spontaneously deflates overnight as He atoms diffuse through the wall of the balloon. Describe the redistribution of matter and/or energy that accompanies this process. 5.

The oxidation of these plastics in air to form carbon dioxide and water is a spontaneous process; however, plastic materials tend to persist in the environment.

The reactions involve electron transfer, and so they are oxidation-reduction (or redox) reactions. Many metals may be purified or electroplated using electrochemical methods. Devices such as automobiles, smartphones, electronic tablets, watches, pacemakers, and many others use batteries for power. Batteries use chemical reactions that produce electricity spontaneously and that can be converted into useful work. All electrochemical systems involve the transfer of electrons in a reacting system. In many systems, the reactions occur in a region known as the cell, where the transfer of electrons occurs at electrodes.

938 Chapter 17 | Electrochemistry 17.1 Balancing Oxidation-Reduction Reactions By the end of this section, you will be able to: Define electrochemistry and a number of important associated terms • Split oxidation-reduction reactions into their oxidation half-reactions and reduction half-reactions • Produce balanced oxidation-reduction equations for reactions in acidic or basic solution • Identify oxidizing agents and reducing agents • Electricity refers to a number of phenomena associated with the presence and flow of electric charge. Electricity includes such diverse things as lightning, static electricity, the current generated by a battery as it discharges, and (Figure 17.2). many other influences on our daily lives. The flow or movement of charge is an electric current Electrons or ions may carry the charge. The elementary unit of charge is the charge of a proton, which is equal in × magnitude to the charge of an electron. The SI unit of charge is the coulomb (C) and the charge of a proton is 1.602 10−19 C. The presence of an electric charge generates an electric field. Electric current is the rate of flow of charge. The SI unit for electrical current is the SI base unit called the ampere (A), which is a flow rate of 1 coulomb of charge per second (1 A = 1 C/s). An electric current flows in a path, called an electric circuit. In most chemical systems, it is necessary to maintain a closed path for current to flow. The flow of charge is generated by an electrical potential difference, or potential, between two points in the circuit. Electrical potential is the ability of the electric field to do work on the charge. The SI unit of electrical potential is the volt (V). When 1 coulomb of charge moves through a Table 17.1 potential difference of 1 volt, it gains or loses 1 joule (J) of energy. summarizes some of this information about electricity.

Chapter 17 | Electrochemistry 939 Electrochemistry studies oxidation-reduction reactions, which were first discussed in an earlier chapter, where we learned that oxidation was the loss of electrons and reduction was the gain of electrons. The reactions discussed tended to be rather simple, and conservation of mass (atom counting by type) and deriving a correctly balanced chemical equation were relatively simple. In this section, we will concentrate on the half-reaction method for balancing oxidation-reduction reactions. The use of half-reactions is important partly for balancing more complicated reactions and partly because many aspects of electrochemistry are easier to discuss in terms of half-reactions. There are alternate methods of balancing these reactions; however, there are no good alternatives to half-reactions for discussing what is occurring in many systems. The half-reaction method splits oxidation-reduction reactions into their oxidation “half” and reduction “half” to make finding the overall equation easier. Electrochemical reactions frequently occur in solutions, which could be acidic, basic, or neutral. When balancing oxidation-reduction reactions, the nature of the solution may be important. It helps to see this in an actual problem. Consider the following unbalanced oxidation-reduction reaction in acidic solution: Fe3+(aq) Fe2+(aq) ⟶Mn2+(aq) −(aq) + MnO4 + We can start by collecting the species we have so far into an unbalanced oxidation half-reaction and an unbalanced reduction half-reaction. Each of these half-reactions contain the same element in two different oxidation states. The Fe2+ Fe3+; has lost an electron to become therefore, the iron underwent oxidation. The reduction is not as obvious; Mn7+ Mn2+. however, the manganese gained five electrons to change from to Fe2+(aq) ⟶Fe3+(aq) oxidation (unbalanced): ⟶Mn2+(aq) −(aq) reduction (unbalanced): MnO4 In acidic solution, there are hydrogen ions present, which are often useful in balancing half-reactions. It may be necessary to use the hydrogen ions directly or as a reactant that may react with oxygen to generate water. Hydrogen ions are very important in acidic solutions where the reactants or products contain hydrogen and/or oxygen. In this example, the oxidation half-reaction involves neither hydrogen nor oxygen, so hydrogen ions are not necessary to the balancing. However, the reduction half-reaction does involve oxygen. It is necessary to use hydrogen ions to convert this oxygen to water. ⟶Mn2+(aq) −(aq) 8H+(aq) + 4H2 O(l) charge not balanced: MnO4 + The situation is different in basic solution because the hydrogen ion concentration is lower and the hydroxide ion concentration is higher. After finishing this example, we will examine how basic solutions differ from acidic solutions. A neutral solution may be treated as acidic or basic, though treating it as acidic is usually easier. The iron atoms in the oxidation half-reaction are balanced (mass balance); however, the charge is unbalanced, since the charges on the ions are not equal. It is necessary to use electrons to balance the charge. The way to balance the charge is by adding electrons to one side of the equation. Adding a single electron on the right side gives a balanced oxidation half-reaction: Fe2+(aq) ⟶Fe3+(aq) e− oxidation (balanced): + You should check the half-reaction for the number of each atom type and the total charge on each side of the equation. The charges include the actual charges of the ions times the number of ions and the charge on an electron times the number of electrons. Fe: Does (1 × 1) = (1 × 1)? Yes. Charge: Does [1 × (+2)] = [1 × (+3) + 1 × (−1)]? Yes. If the atoms and charges balance, the half-reaction is balanced. In oxidation half-reactions, electrons appear as products (on the right). As discussed in the earlier chapter, since iron underwent oxidation, iron is the reducing agent. Now return to the reduction half-reaction equation: 

--- Page 948 ---
940 Chapter 17 | Electrochemistry ⟶Mn2+(aq) −(aq) 8H+(aq) reduction (unbalanced): MnO4 + + 4H2 O(l) The atoms are balanced (mass balance), so it is now necessary to check for charge balance. The total charge on the × × × left of the reaction arrow is [(−1) (1) + (8) (+1)], or +7, while the total charge on the right side is [(1) (+2) + × (4) (0)], or +2. The difference between +7 and +2 is five; therefore, it is necessary to add five electrons to the left side to achieve charge balance. 5e−⟶Mn2+(aq) 8H+(aq) −(aq) + O(l) Reduction (balanced): MnO4 + + 4H2 You should check this half-reaction for each atom type and for the charge, as well: Mn: Does (1 × 1) = (1 × 1)? Yes. H: Does (8 × 1) = (4 × 2)? Yes. O: Does (1 × 4) = (4 × 1)? Yes. Charge: Does [1 × (−1) + 8 × (+1) + 5 × (−1)] = [1 × (+2)]? Yes. Now that this half-reaction is balanced, it is easy to see it involves reduction because electrons were gained when −was Mn2+. MnO4 reduced to In all reduction half-reactions, electrons appear as reactants (on the left side). As −in MnO4 this case, is also called the oxidizing agent. discussed in the earlier chapter, the species that was reduced, We now have two balanced half-reactions. Fe2+(aq) ⟶Fe3+(aq) e− oxidation: + 5e−⟶Mn2+(aq) 8H+(aq) −(aq) reduction: MnO4 + + + 4H2 O(l) It is now necessary to combine the two halves to produce a whole reaction. The key to combining the half-reactions is the electrons. The electrons lost during oxidation must go somewhere. These electrons go to cause reduction. The number of electrons transferred from the oxidation half-reaction to the reduction half-reaction must be equal. There can be no missing or excess electrons. In this example, the oxidation half-reaction generates one electron, while the reduction half-reaction requires five. The lowest common multiple of one and five is five; therefore, it is necessary to multiply every term in the oxidation half-reaction by five and every term in the reduction half-reaction by one. (In this case, the multiplication of the reduction half-reaction generates no change; however, this will not always be the case.) The multiplication of the two half-reactions by the appropriate factor followed by addition of the two halves gives (Fe2+(aq) ⟶Fe3+(aq) e−) oxidation: 5 × + 5e−⟶Mn2+(aq) 8H+(aq) −(aq) reduction: MnO4 + + + 4H2 O(l) 5Fe2+(aq) ⟶5Fe3+(aq) Mn2+(aq) −(aq) 8H+(aq) overall: + MnO4 + + + 4H2 O(l) The electrons do not appear in the final answer because the oxidation electrons are the same electrons as the reduction electrons and they “cancel.” Carefully check each side of the overall equation to verify everything was combined correctly: Fe: Does (5 × 1) = (5 × 1)? Yes. × 1) = (1 × 1)? Yes. Mn: Does (1 H: Does (8 × 1) = (4 × 2)? Yes. O: Does (1 × 4) = (4 × 1)? Yes. Charge: Does [5 × (+2) + 1 × (−1) + 8 × (+1)] = [5 × (+3) + 1 × (+2)]? Yes. Everything checks, so this is the overall equation in acidic solution. If something does not check, the most common error occurs during the multiplication of the individual half-reactions. Now suppose we wanted the solution to be basic. Recall that basic solutions have excess hydroxide ions. Some of these hydroxide ions will react with hydrogen ions to produce water.

Chapter 17 | Electrochemistry 941 overall equation in basic solution is to start with the balanced equation in acidic solution, then “convert” it to the equation for basic solution. However, it is necessary to exercise caution when doing this, as many reactants behave differently under basic conditions and many metal ions will precipitate as the metal hydroxide. We just produced the following reaction, which we want to change to a basic reaction: 5Fe2+(aq) ⟶5Fe3+(aq) Mn2+(aq) −(aq) 8H+(aq) + MnO4 + + + 4H2 O(l) −normally MnO4 However, under basic conditions, reduces to MnO2 and iron will be present as either Fe(OH)2 or Fe(OH)3. For these reasons, under basic conditions, this reaction will be −(aq) OH−(aq) 3Fe(OH)2(s) ⟶3Fe(OH)3(s) + MnO4 + 2H2 O(l) + MnO2(s) + −will 2−, MnO4 MnO4 (Under very basic conditions reduce to instead of MnO2.) It is still possible to balance any oxidation-reduction reaction as an acidic reaction and then, when necessary, convert the equation to a basic reaction. This will work if the acidic and basic reactants and products are the same or if the basic reactants and products are used before the conversion from acidic or basic. There are very few examples in which the acidic and basic reactions will involve the same reactants and products. However, balancing a basic reaction as acidic and then converting to basic will work. To convert to a basic reaction, it is necessary to add the same number (H+) of hydroxide ions to each side of the equation so that all the hydrogen ions are removed and mass balance is (OH−) maintained. Hydrogen ion combines with hydroxide ion to produce water. Let us now try a basic equation. We will start with the following basic reaction: Cl−(aq) −(aq) −(aq) + MnO4 ⟶ClO3 + MnO2(s) Balancing this as acid gives Cl−(aq) −(aq) 2H+(aq) −(aq) + 2MnO2(s) + H2 O(l) + 2MnO4 + ⟶ClO3 In this case, it is necessary to add two hydroxide ions to each side of the equation to convert the two hydrogen ions on the left into water: Cl−(aq) −(aq) (2H+ 2OH−)(aq) 2OH−(aq) −(aq) + 2MnO4 + + ⟶ClO3 + 2MnO2(s) + H2 O(l) + Cl−(aq) −(aq) 2OH−(aq) −(aq) + 2MnO4 + (2H2 O)(l) ⟶ClO3 + 2MnO2(s) + H2 O(l) + Note that both sides of the equation show water. Simplifying should be done when necessary, and gives the desired equation. In this case, it is necessary to remove one H2O from each side of the reaction arrows. Cl−(aq) −(aq) 2OH−(aq) −(aq) + 2MnO4 + H2 O(l) ⟶ClO3 + 2MnO2(s) + Again, check each side of the overall equation to make sure there are no errors: Cl: Does (1 × 1) = (1 × 1)? Yes. (2 × 1) = (2 × 1)? Yes. Mn: Does H: Does (1 × 2) = (2 × 1)? Yes. O: Does (2 × 4 + 1 × 1) = (3 × 1 + 2 × 2 + 2 × 1)? Yes. Charge: Does [1 × (−1) + 2 × (−1)] = [1 × (−1) + 2 × (−1)]? Yes.

In writing the equations, it is often convenient to separate the oxidation-reduction reactions into half-reactions to facilitate balancing the overall equation and to emphasize the actual chemical transformations. (Figure 17.3). Consider what happens when a clean piece of copper metal is placed in a solution of silver nitrate As soon as the copper metal is added, silver metal begins to form and copper ions pass into the solution. The blue color of the solution on the far right indicates the presence of copper ions. The reaction may be split into its two half-reactions. Half-reactions separate the oxidation from the reduction, so each can be considered individually. ⟶Cu2+(aq) 2e− oxidation: Cu(s) + (Ag+(aq) e−⟶Ag(s)) 2Ag+(aq) 2e−⟶2Ag(s) reduction: 2 × + or + Cu2+(aq) 2Ag+(aq) overall: + Cu(s) ⟶2Ag(s) + The equation for the reduction half-reaction had to be doubled so the number electrons “gained” in the reduction half- reaction equaled the number of electrons “lost” in the oxidation half-reaction.

946 Chapter 17 | Electrochemistry Figure 17.3 When a clean piece of copper metal is placed into a clear solution of silver nitrate (a), an oxidation- Cu2+ Ag+ reduction reaction occurs that results in the exchange of for ions in solution. As the reaction proceeds (b), the solution turns blue (c) because of the copper ions present, and silver metal is deposited on the copper strip as the silver ions are removed from solution. (credit: modification of work by Mark Ott) Galvanic or voltaic cells involve spontaneous electrochemical reactions in which the half-reactions are separated (Figure 17.4) so that current can flow through an external wire. The beaker on the left side of the figure is called a half-cell, and contains a 1 M solution of copper(II) nitrate [Cu(NO3)2] with a piece of copper metal partially submerged in the solution. The copper metal is an electrode. The copper is undergoing oxidation; therefore, the copper electrode is the anode. The anode is connected to a voltmeter with a wire and the other terminal of the voltmeter is connected to a silver electrode by a wire. The silver is undergoing reduction; therefore, the silver electrode is the cathode. The half-cell on the right side of the figure consists of the silver electrode in a 1 M solution of silver nitrate (AgNO3). At this point, no current flows—that is, no significant movement of electrons through the wire occurs because the circuit is open. The circuit is closed using a salt bridge, which transmits the current with moving ions. The salt bridge consists of a concentrated, nonreactive, electrolyte solution such as the sodium nitrate (NaNO3) solution used in this example. As electrons flow from left to right through the electrode and wire, nitrate ions (anions) pass through the porous plug on the left into the copper(II) nitrate solution. This keeps the beaker on the left electrically neutral by neutralizing the charge on the copper(II) ions that are produced in the solution as the copper metal is oxidized. At the same time, the nitrate ions are moving to the left, sodium ions (cations) move to the right, through the porous plug, and into the silver nitrate solution on the right. These added cations “replace” the silver ions that are removed from the solution as they were reduced to silver metal, keeping the beaker on the right electrically neutral. Without the salt bridge, the compartments would not remain electrically neutral and no significant current would flow. However, if the two compartments are in direct contact, a salt bridge is not necessary. The instant the circuit is completed, the voltmeter reads +0.46 V, this is called the cell potential. The cell potential is created when the two dissimilar metals are connected, and is a measure of the energy per unit charge available from the oxidation-reduction reaction. The volt is the derived SI unit for electrical potential kg/m2 J J volt = V = = = A/s C A/s3 In this equation, A is the current in amperes and C the charge in coulombs. Note that volts must be multiplied by the charge in coulombs (C) to obtain the energy in joules (J). https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

Chapter 17 | Electrochemistry 947 Figure 17.4 In this standard galvanic cell, the half-cells are separated; electrons can flow through an external wire and become available to do electrical work. When the electrochemical cell is constructed in this fashion, a positive cell potential indicates a spontaneous reaction Figure 17.4, and that the electrons are flowing from the left to the right. There is a lot going on in so it is useful to summarize things for this system: Electrons flow from the anode to the cathode: left to right in the standard galvanic cell in the figure. • The electrode in the left half-cell is the anode because oxidation occurs here. The name refers to the flow of • anions in the salt bridge toward it. The electrode in the right half-cell is the cathode because reduction occurs here. The name refers to the flow • of cations in the salt bridge toward it. Oxidation occurs at the anode (the left half-cell in the figure). • Reduction occurs at the cathode (the right half-cell in the figure). • The cell potential, +0.46 V, in this case, results from the inherent differences in the nature of the materials • used to make the two half-cells. The salt bridge must be present to close (complete) the circuit and both an oxidation and reduction must occur • for current to flow. There are many possible galvanic cells, so a shorthand notation is usually used to describe them. The cell notation (sometimes called a cell diagram) provides information about the various species involved in the reaction. This

Information about the anode is written to the left, followed by the anode solution, then the salt bridge (when present), then the cathode solution, and, finally, information about the cathode to the right. The cell notation for the Figure 17.4 galvanic cell in is then │Cu2+(aq, ║Ag+(aq, │Ag(s) Cu(s) 1 M) 1 M) Note that spectator ions are not included and that the simplest form of each half-reaction was used. When known, the initial concentrations of the various ions are usually included. One of the simplest cells is the Daniell cell. It is possible to construct this battery by placing a copper electrode at the bottom of a jar and covering the metal with a copper sulfate solution. A zinc sulfate solution is floated on top of the copper sulfate solution; then a zinc electrode is placed in the zinc sulfate solution. Connecting the copper electrode to the zinc electrode allows an electric current to flow. This is an example of a cell without a salt bridge, and ions may flow across the interface between the two solutions. Some oxidation-reduction reactions involve species that are poor conductors of electricity, and so an electrode is used that does not participate in the reactions. Frequently, the electrode is platinum, gold, or graphite, all of which are Figure 17.5. inert to many chemical reactions. One such system is shown in Magnesium undergoes oxidation at the anode on the left in the figure and hydrogen ions undergo reduction at the cathode on the right. The reaction may be summarized as ⟶Mg2+(aq) 2e− oxidation: Mg(s) + 2H+(aq) 2e−⟶H2(g) reduction: + ⟶Mg2+(aq) 2H+(aq) overall: Mg(s) + + H2(g) The cell used an inert platinum wire for the cathode, so the cell notation is │Mg2+(aq) ║H+(aq) │Pt(s) Mg(s) │H2(g) The magnesium electrode is an active electrode because it participates in the oxidation-reduction reaction. Inert Figure 17.5, electrodes, like the platinum electrode in do not participate in the oxidation-reduction reaction and are present so that current can flow through the cell. Platinum or gold generally make good inert electrodes because they are chemically unreactive.

While it is impossible to determine the electrical potential of a single electrode, we can assign an electrode the value Figure 17.6 of zero and then use it as a reference. The electrode chosen as the zero is shown in and is called the standard hydrogen electrode (SHE). The SHE consists of 1 atm of hydrogen gas bubbled through a 1 M HCl solution, usually at room temperature. Platinum, which is chemically inert, is used as the electrode.

In galvanic cells, chemical energy is converted into electrical energy, which can do work.

Chapter 17 | Electrochemistry 957 −wele Ecell = or wele = −nFEcell nF The negative sign for the work indicates that the electrical work is done by the system (the galvanic cell) on the surroundings. In an earlier chapter, the free energy was defined as the energy that was available to do work. In particular, the change in free energy was defined in terms of the maximum work (wmax), which, for electrochemical systems, is wele. ΔG = wmax = wele ΔG = −nFEcell We can verify the signs are correct when we realize that n and F are positive constants and that galvanic cells, which have positive cell potentials, involve spontaneous reactions. Thus, spontaneous reactions, which have ΔG < 0, must have Ecell > 0. If all the reactants and products are in their standard states, this becomes ΔG° = −nFEcell ° This provides a way to relate standard cell potentials to equilibrium constants, since ΔG° = −RT ln K RT −nFEcell ° = −RT ln K or Ecell ° ln K = nF Most of the time, the electrochemical reactions are run at standard temperature (298.15 K).

With the Nernst equation, it is possible to calculate the cell potential at nonstandard conditions. This adjustment is necessary because potentials determined under different conditions will have different values.

In a concentration cell, the electrodes are the same material and the half-cells differ only in concentration.

In principle, any galvanic cell could be used as a battery. An ideal battery would never run down, produce an unchanging voltage, and be capable of withstanding environmental extremes of heat and humidity. Real batteries strike a balance between ideal characteristics and practical limitations. For example, the mass of a car battery is about 18 kg or about 1% of the mass of an average car or light-duty truck. This type of battery would supply nearly unlimited energy if used in a smartphone, but would be rejected for this application because of its mass. Thus, no single battery is “best” and batteries are selected for a particular application, keeping things like the mass of the battery, its cost, reliability, and current capacity in mind. There are two basic types of batteries: primary and secondary. A few batteries of each type are described next. https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

Primary Batteries Primary batteries are single-use batteries because they cannot be recharged. A common primary battery is the dry (Figure 17.10). cell The dry cell is a zinc-carbon battery. The zinc can serves as both a container and the negative electrode. The positive electrode is a rod made of carbon that is surrounded by a paste of manganese(IV) oxide, zinc chloride, ammonium chloride, carbon powder, and a small amount of water. The reaction at the anode can be represented as the ordinary oxidation of zinc: ⟶Zn2+(aq) 2e− + = −0.7618 V Zn(s) EZn2+ ° /Zn The reaction at the cathode is more complicated, in part because more than one reaction occurs. The series of reactions that occurs at the cathode is approximately e−⟶Mn2 2Cl− 2MnO2(s) + 2NH4 Cl(aq) + 2 O3(s) + 2NH3(aq) + H2 O(l) + The overall reaction for the zinc–carbon battery can be represented as ⟶Zn2+(aq) 2Cl−with 2MnO2(s) + 2NH4 Cl(aq) + Zn(s) + Mn2 O3(s) + 2NH3(aq) + H2 O(l) + an overall cell potential which is initially about 1.5 V, but decreases as the battery is used. It is important to remember that the voltage delivered by a battery is the same regardless of the size of a battery. For this reason, D, C, A, AA, and AAA batteries all have the same voltage rating. However, larger batteries can deliver more moles of electrons. As the zinc container oxidizes, its contents eventually leak out, so this type of battery should not be left in any electrical device for extended periods. Figure 17.10 The diagram shows a cross section of a flashlight battery, a zinc-carbon dry cell.

(Figure 17.11) Alkaline batteries were developed in the 1950s partly to address some of the performance issues with zinc–carbon dry cells. They are manufactured to be exact replacements for zinc-carbon dry cells. As their name suggests, these types of batteries use alkaline electrolytes, often potassium hydroxide. The reactions are 2e− 2OH−(aq) O(l) + Eanode ° = −1.28 V anode: Zn(s) + ⟶ZnO(s) + H2 2e−⟶Mn2 2OH−(aq) cathode: 2MnO2(s) + H2 O(l) + O3(s) + Ecathode ° = +0.15 V overall: Zn(s) + 2MnO2(s) ⟶ZnO(s) + Mn2 O3(s) Ecell ° = +1.43 V An alkaline battery can deliver about three to five times the energy of a zinc-carbon dry cell of similar size. Alkaline batteries are prone to leaking potassium hydroxide, so these should also be removed from devices for long-term storage. While some alkaline batteries are rechargeable, most are not. Attempts to recharge an alkaline battery that is not rechargeable often leads to rupture of the battery and leakage of the potassium hydroxide electrolyte.

Chapter 17 | Electrochemistry 963 Secondary Batteries Secondary batteries are rechargeable. These are the types of batteries found in devices such as smartphones, electronic tablets, and automobiles. (Figure 17.12) Nickel-cadmium, or NiCd, batteries consist of a nickel-plated cathode, cadmium-plated anode, and a potassium hydroxide electrode. The positive and negative plates, which are prevented from shorting by the separator, are rolled together and put into the case. This is a “jelly-roll” design and allows the NiCd cell to deliver much more current than a similar-sized alkaline battery. The reactions are 2e− 2OH−(aq) ⟶Cd(OH)2(s) anode: Cd(s) + + 2OH−(aq) 2e−⟶Ni(OH)2(s) cathode: NiO2(s) + 2H2 O(l) + + overall: Cd(s) + NiO2(s) + 2H2 O(l) + ⟶Cd(OH)2(s) Ni(OH)2(s) The voltage is about 1.2 V to 1.25 V as the battery discharges. When properly treated, a NiCd battery can be recharged about 1000 times. Cadmium is a toxic heavy metal so NiCd batteries should never be opened or put into the regular trash. Figure 17.12 NiCd batteries use a “jelly-roll” design that significantly increases the amount of current the battery can deliver as compared to a similar-sized alkaline battery.

Chapter 17 | Electrochemistry 967 17.6 Corrosion By the end of this section, you will be able to: Define corrosion • List some of the methods used to prevent or slow corrosion • Corrosion is usually defined as the degradation of metals due to an electrochemical process. The formation of rust on iron, tarnish on silver, and the blue-green patina that develops on copper are all examples of corrosion. The total cost of corrosion in the United States is significant, with estimates in excess of half a trillion dollars a year. Chemistry in Everyday Life Statue of Liberty: Changing Colors The Statue of Liberty is a landmark every American recognizes. The Statue of Liberty is easily identified by its height, stance, and unique blue-green color (Figure 17.16). When this statue was first delivered from France, its appearance was not green. It was brown, the color of its copper “skin.” So how did the Statue of Liberty change colors? The change in appearance was a direct result of corrosion. The copper that is the primary component of the statue slowly underwent oxidation from the air. The oxidation-reduction reactions of copper metal in the environment occur in several steps. Copper metal is oxidized to copper(I) oxide (Cu2O), which is red, and then to copper(II) oxide, which is black 1 (red) 2Cu(s) + 2O2(g) ⟶Cu2 O(s) 1 Cu2 O(s) + O2(g) ⟶2CuO(s) (black) 2 Coal, which was often high in sulfur, was burned extensively in the early part of the last century. As a result, sulfur trioxide, carbon dioxide, and water all reacted with the CuO 2CuO(s) + CO2(g) + H2 O(l) ⟶Cu2 CO3 (OH)2(s) (green) 3CuO(s) + 2CO2(g) + H2 O(l) ⟶Cu2 (CO3)2 (OH)2(s) (blue) 4CuO(s) + SO3(g) + 3H2 O(l) ⟶Cu4 SO4 (OH)6(s) (green) These three compounds are responsible for the characteristic blue-green patina seen today. Fortunately, formation of the patina created a protective layer on the surface, preventing further corrosion of the copper skin. The formation of the protective layer is a form of passivation, which is discussed further in a later chapter.

(b) Exposure to the elements has resulted in the formation of the blue-green patina seen today. Perhaps the most familiar example of corrosion is the formation of rust on iron. Iron will rust when it is exposed (Figure 17.17). to oxygen and water. The main steps in the rusting of iron appear to involve the following Once exposed to the atmosphere, iron rapidly oxidizes. ⟶Fe2+(aq) 2e− = −0.44 V anode: Fe(s) + EFe2+ ° /Fe The electrons reduce oxygen in the air in acidic solutions. 2H+(aq) 4e−⟶2H2 cathode: O2(g) + + O(l) EO2 ° = +1.23 V /O2 ⟶2Fe2+(aq) 4H+(aq) = +1.67 V overall: 2Fe(s) + O2(g) + + 2H2 O(l) Ecell ° What we call rust is hydrated iron(III) oxide, which forms when iron(II) ions react further with oxygen. 4Fe2+(aq) 8H+(aq) (4 + 2x) H2 O(l) ⟶2Fe2 O3 ·xH2 O(s) + + O2(g) + The number of water molecules is variable, so it is represented by x. Unlike the patina on copper, the formation of rust does not create a protective layer and so corrosion of the iron continues as the rust flakes off and exposes fresh iron to the atmosphere. https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

Chapter 17 | Electrochemistry 969 Figure 17.17 Once the paint is scratched on a painted iron surface, corrosion occurs and rust begins to form. The speed of the spontaneous reaction is increased in the presence of electrolytes, such as the sodium chloride used on roads to melt ice and snow or in salt water. One way to keep iron from corroding is to keep it painted. The layer of paint prevents the water and oxygen necessary for rust formation from coming into contact with the iron. As long as the paint remains intact, the iron is protected from corrosion. Other strategies include alloying the iron with other metals. For example, stainless steel is mostly iron with a bit of chromium. The chromium tends to collect near the surface, where it forms an oxide layer that protects the iron. Zinc-plated or galvanized iron uses a different strategy. Zinc is more easily oxidized than iron because zinc has a lower reduction potential. Since zinc has a lower reduction potential, it is a more active metal. Thus, even if the zinc coating is scratched, the zinc will still oxidize before the iron. This suggests that this approach should work with other active metals. Another important way to protect metal is to make it the cathode in a galvanic cell. This is cathodic protection and can be used for metals other than just iron. For example, the rusting of underground iron storage tanks and pipes (Figure can be prevented or greatly reduced by connecting them to a more active metal such as zinc or magnesium 17.18). This is also used to protect the metal parts in water heaters. The more active metals (lower reduction potential) are called sacrificial anodes because as they get used up as they corrode (oxidize) at the anode. The metal being protected serves as the cathode, and so does not oxidize (corrode). When the anodes are properly monitored and periodically replaced, the useful lifetime of the iron storage tank can be greatly extended.

970 Chapter 17 | Electrochemistry Figure 17.18 One way to protect an underground iron storage tank is through cathodic protection. Using an active metal like zinc or magnesium for the anode effectively makes the storage tank the cathode, preventing it from corroding (oxidizing). 17.7 Electrolysis By the end of this section, you will be able to: Describe electrolytic cells and their relationship to galvanic cells • Perform various calculations related to electrolysis • In galvanic cells, chemical energy is converted into electrical energy. The opposite is true for electrolytic cells. In electrolytic cells, electrical energy causes nonspontaneous reactions to occur in a process known as electrolysis. The Figure 17.1 charging electric car pictured in at the beginning of this chapter shows one such process. Electrical energy is converted into the chemical energy in the battery as it is charged. Once charged, the battery can be used to power the automobile. The same principles are involved in electrolytic cells as in galvanic cells. We will look at three electrolytic cells and the quantitative aspects of electrolysis. The Electrolysis of Molten Sodium Chloride In molten sodium chloride, the ions are free to migrate to the electrodes of an electrolytic cell. A simplified diagram of Figure 17.19. the cell commercially used to produce sodium metal and chlorine gas is shown in Sodium is a strong reducing agent and chlorine is used to purify water, and is used in antiseptics and in paper production. The reactions are 2Cl−(l) 2e− anode: ⟶Cl2(g) + ECl2 ° = +1.3 V /Cl− Na+(l) e−⟶Na(l) cathode: ° = −2.7 V + ENa+ /Na 2Na+(l) 2Cl−(l) overall: + ⟶2Na(l) + Cl2(g) Ecell ° = −4.0 V The power supply (battery) must supply a minimum of 4 V, but, in practice, the applied voltages are typically higher because of inefficiencies in the process itself. https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

Chapter 17 | Electrochemistry 971 Figure 17.19 Passing an electric current through molten sodium chloride decomposes the material into sodium metal and chlorine gas. Care must be taken to keep the products separated to prevent the spontaneous formation of sodium chloride. The Electrolysis of Water It is possible to split water into hydrogen and oxygen gas by electrolysis. Acids are typically added to increase the (Figure 17.20). concentration of hydrogen ion in solution The reactions are 4H+(aq) 4e− ⟶O2(g) + + Eanode ° = +1.229 V anode: 2H2 O(l) 2H+(aq) 2e−⟶H2(g) cathode: + Ecathode ° = 0 V ⟶2H2(g) + O2(g) Ecell ° = −1.229 V overall: 2H2 O(l) Note that the sulfuric acid is not consumed and that the volume of hydrogen gas produced is twice the volume of oxygen gas produced. The minimum applied voltage is 1.229 V. 

--- Page 980 ---
972 Chapter 17 | Electrochemistry Figure 17.20 Water decomposes into oxygen and hydrogen gas during electrolysis. Sulfuric acid was added to increase the concentration of hydrogen ions and the total number of ions in solution, but does not take part in the reaction. The volume of hydrogen gas collected is twice the volume of oxygen gas collected, due to the stoichiometry of the reaction. The Electrolysis of Aqueous Sodium Chloride The electrolysis of aqueous sodium chloride is the more common example of electrolysis because more than one species can be oxidized and reduced. Considering the anode first, the possible reactions are 2Cl−(aq) e− (i) ⟶Cl2(g) + 2 Eanode ° = +1.35827 V 4H+(aq) 4e− (ii) 2H2 O(l) ⟶O2(g) + + Eanode ° = +1.229 V These values suggest that water should be oxidized at the anode because a smaller potential would be needed—using reaction (ii) for the oxidation would give a less-negative cell potential. When the experiment is run, it turns out chlorine, not oxygen, is produced at the anode. The unexpected process is so common in electrochemistry that it has been given the name overpotential. The overpotential is the difference between the theoretical cell voltage and the actual voltage that is necessary to cause electrolysis. It turns out that the overpotential for oxygen is rather high and effectively makes the reduction potential more positive. As a result, under normal conditions, chlorine gas is what actually forms at the anode. Now consider the cathode. Three reductions could occur: https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

Under standard state conditions, reaction (iii) would be preferred to reaction (iv). However, the pH of a sodium chloride solution is 7, so the concentration of 10−7 × hydrogen ions is only 1 M. At such low concentrations, reaction (iii) is unlikely and reaction (iv) occurs. The overall reaction is then 2Cl−(aq) 2OH−(aq) overall: 2H2 O(l) + ⟶H2(g) + Cl2(g) + Ecell ° = −2.186 V As the reaction proceeds, hydroxide ions replace chloride ions in solution. Thus, sodium hydroxide can be obtained by evaporating the water after the electrolysis is complete. Sodium hydroxide is valuable in its own right and is used for things like oven cleaner, drain opener, and in the production of paper, fabrics, and soap. Chemistry in Everyday Life Electroplating An important use for electrolytic cells is in electroplating. Electroplating results in a thin coating of one metal on top of a conducting surface. Reasons for electroplating include making the object more corrosion resistant, strengthening the surface, producing a more attractive finish, or for purifying metal. The metals commonly used in electroplating include cadmium, chromium, copper, gold, nickel, silver, and tin. Common consumer products include silver-plated or gold-plated tableware, chrome-plated automobile parts, and jewelry. We can get an idea of how this works by investigating how silver-plated tableware is produced (Figure 17.21). Figure 17.21 The spoon, which is made of an inexpensive metal, is connected to the negative terminal of the voltage source and acts as the cathode. The anode is a silver electrode. Both electrodes are immersed in a silver nitrate solution. When a steady current is passed through the solution, the net result is that silver metal is removed from the anode and deposited on the cathode. In the figure, the anode consists of a silver electrode, shown on the left. The cathode is located on the right and is the spoon, which is made from inexpensive metal. Both electrodes are immersed in a solution of silver nitrate. As the potential is increased, current flows. Silver metal is lost at the anode as it goes into solution. ⟶Ag+(aq) e− anode: Ag(s) +

The quality of the object is usually determined by the thickness of the deposited silver and the rate of deposition. Quantitative Aspects of Electrolysis The amount of current that is allowed to flow in an electrolytic cell is related to the number of moles of electrons. The number of moles of electrons can be related to the reactants and products using stoichiometry. Recall that the SI unit Cs for current (I) is the ampere (A), which is the equivalent of 1 coulomb per second (1 A = 1 ). The total charge (Q, in coulombs) is given by Q = I × t = n × F Where t is the time in seconds, n the number of moles of electrons, and F is the Faraday constant. Moles of electrons can be used in stoichiometry problems. The time required to deposit a specified amount of metal might also be requested, as in the second of the following examples. Example 17.8 Converting Current to Moles of Electrons In one process used for electroplating silver, a current of 10.23 A was passed through an electrolytic cell for exactly 1 hour. How many moles of electrons passed through the cell? What mass of silver was deposited at the cathode from the silver nitrate solution?

How long would it take to deposit the layer of g/cm3. chromium if the current was 33.46 A? The density of chromium (metal) is 7.19 Solution This problem brings in a number of topics covered earlier. An outline of what needs to be done is: If the total charge can be determined, the time required is just the charge divided by the current • The total charge can be obtained from the amount of Cr needed and the stoichiometry • The amount of Cr can be obtained using the density and the volume Cr required • The volume Cr required is the thickness times the area • Solving in steps, and taking care with the units, the volume of Cr required is ⎞ ⎞ ⎛ ⎛ ⎛ ⎞ cm2 10,000 1 cm ⎠ ⎠= ⎝3.3 ⎝ cm3 m2 volume = ⎝0.010 mm × 33 ⎠× × 10 mm m2 1 Cubic centimeters were used because they match the volume unit used for the density.

The charge may be in the form of electrons or ions. Current flows through an unbroken or closed circular path called a circuit. The current flows through a conducting medium as a result of a difference in electrical potential between two points in a circuit. Electrical potential has the units of energy ⎛ ⎞ Cs ⎝A = ⎠, per charge. In SI units, charge is measured in coulombs (C), current in amperes and electrical potential in ⎛ ⎞ J ⎝V = ⎠. volts C Oxidation is the loss of electrons, and the species that is oxidized is also called the reducing agent. Reduction is the gain of electrons, and the species that is reduced is also called the oxidizing agent. Oxidation-reduction reactions can be balanced using the half-reaction method. In this method, the oxidation-reduction reaction is split into an oxidation half-reaction and a reduction half-reaction. The oxidation half-reaction and reduction half-reaction are then balanced separately. Each of the half-reactions must have the same number of each type of atom on both sides of the equation and show the same total charge on each side of the equation. Charge is balanced in oxidation half-reactions by adding electrons as products; in reduction half-reactions, charge is balanced by adding electrons as reactants. The total number of electrons gained by reduction must exactly equal the number of electrons lost by oxidation when combining the two half-reactions to give the overall balanced equation. Balancing oxidation-reduction reaction equations in aqueous solutions frequently requires that oxygen or hydrogen be added or removed from a reactant. In (H+) acidic solution, hydrogen is added by adding hydrogen ion and removed by producing hydrogen ion; oxygen is removed by adding hydrogen ion and producing water, and added by adding water and producing hydrogen ion. A balanced equation in basic solution can be obtained by first balancing the equation in acidic solution, and then adding hydroxide ion to each side of the balanced equation in such numbers that all the hydrogen ions are converted to water. 17.2 Galvanic Cells Electrochemical cells typically consist of two half-cells. The half-cells separate the oxidation half-reaction from the reduction half-reaction and make it possible for current to flow through an external wire. One half-cell, normally depicted on the left side in a figure, contains the anode. Oxidation occurs at the anode. The anode is connected to the cathode in the other half-cell, often shown on the right side in a figure. Reduction occurs at the cathode.

Chapter 17 | Electrochemistry 979 salt bridge completes the circuit allowing current to flow. Anions in the salt bridge flow toward the anode and cations in the salt bridge flow toward the cathode. The movement of these ions completes the circuit and keeps each half- cell electrically neutral. Electrochemical cells can be described using cell notation. In this notation, information about the reaction at the anode appears on the left and information about the reaction at the cathode on the right. The salt ‖. bridge is represented by a double line, The solid, liquid, or aqueous phases within a half-cell are separated by a single line, │. The phase and concentration of the various species is included after the species name. Electrodes that participate in the oxidation-reduction reaction are called active electrodes. Electrodes that do not participate in the oxidation-reduction reaction but are there to allow current to flow are inert electrodes. Inert electrodes are often made from platinum or gold, which are unchanged by many chemical reactions. 17.3 Standard Reduction Potentials Assigning the potential of the standard hydrogen electrode (SHE) as zero volts allows the determination of standard reduction potentials, E°, for half-reactions in electrochemical cells. As the name implies, standard reduction potentials use standard states (1 bar or 1 atm for gases; 1 M for solutes, often at 298.15 K) and are written as reductions (where electrons appear on the left side of the equation). The reduction reactions are reversible, so standard cell potentials can be calculated by subtracting the standard reduction potential for the reaction at the anode from the standard reduction for the reaction at the cathode. When calculating the standard cell potential, the standard reduction potentials are not scaled by the stoichiometric coefficients in the balanced overall equation. 17.4 The Nernst Equation Electrical work (wele) is the negative of the product of the total charge (Q) and the cell potential (Ecell). The total e−). charge can be calculated as the number of moles of electrons (n) times the Faraday constant (F = 96,485 C/mol Electrical work is the maximum work that the system can produce and so is equal to the change in free energy. Thus, anything that can be done with or to a free energy change can also be done to or with a cell potential. The Nernst equation relates the cell potential at nonstandard conditions to the logarithm of the reaction quotient. Concentration cells exploit this relationship and produce a positive cell potential using half-cells that differ only in the concentration of their solutes. 17.5 Batteries and Fuel Cells Batteries are galvanic cells, or a series of cells, that produce an electric current. When cells are combined into batteries, the potential of the battery is an integer multiple of the potential of a single cell. There are two basic types of batteries: primary and secondary. Primary batteries are “single use” and cannot be recharged. Dry cells and (most) alkaline batteries are examples of primary batteries. The second type is rechargeable and is called a secondary battery. Examples of secondary batteries include nickel-cadmium (NiCd), lead acid, and lithium ion batteries. Fuel cells are similar to batteries in that they generate an electrical current, but require continuous addition of fuel and oxidizer. The hydrogen fuel cell uses hydrogen and oxygen from the air to produce water, and is generally more efficient than internal combustion engines. 17.6 Corrosion Corrosion is the degradation of a metal caused by an electrochemical process. Large sums of money are spent each year repairing the effects of, or preventing, corrosion. Some metals, such as aluminum and copper, produce a protective layer when they corrode in air. The thin layer that forms on the surface of the metal prevents oxygen from coming into contact with more of the metal atoms and thus “protects” the remaining metal from further corrosion. Iron corrodes (forms rust) when exposed to water and oxygen. The rust that forms on iron metal flakes off, exposing fresh metal, which also corrodes. One way to prevent, or slow, corrosion is by coating the metal. Coating prevents water and oxygen from contacting the metal. Paint or other coatings will slow corrosion, but they are not effective once scratched. Zinc-plated or galvanized iron exploits the fact that zinc is more likely to oxidize than iron. As long as the coating remains, even if scratched, the zinc will oxidize before the iron. Another method for protecting metals is cathodic protection. In this method, an easily oxidized and inexpensive metal, often zinc or magnesium (the sacrificial anode), is electrically connected to the metal that must be protected. The more active metal is the sacrificial anode, 

--- Page 988 ---
980 Chapter 17 | Electrochemistry and is the anode in a galvanic cell. The “protected” metal is the cathode, and remains unoxidized. One advantage of cathodic protection is that the sacrificial anode can be monitored and replaced if needed. 17.7 Electrolysis Using electricity to force a nonspontaneous process to occur is electrolysis. Electrolytic cells are electrochemical cells with negative cell potentials (meaning a positive Gibbs free energy), and so are nonspontaneous. Electrolysis can occur in electrolytic cells by introducing a power supply, which supplies the energy to force the electrons to flow in the nonspontaneous direction. Electrolysis is done in solutions, which contain enough ions so current can flow. If the solution contains only one material, like the electrolysis of molten sodium chloride, it is a simple matter to determine what is oxidized and what is reduced. In more complicated systems, like the electrolysis of aqueous sodium chloride, more than one species can be oxidized or reduced and the standard reduction potentials are used to determine the most likely oxidation (the half-reaction with the largest [most positive] standard reduction potential) and reduction (the half-reaction with the smallest [least positive] standard reduction potential). Sometimes unexpected half-reactions occur because of overpotential. Overpotential is the difference between the theoretical half-reaction reduction potential and the actual voltage required. When present, the applied potential must be increased, making it possible for a different reaction to occur in the electrolytic cell. The total charge, Q, that passes through an electrolytic cell can be expressed as the current (I) multiplied by time (Q = It) or as the moles of electrons (n) multiplied by Faraday’s constant (Q = nF). These relationships can be used to determine things like the amount of material used or generated during electrolysis, how long the reaction must proceed, or what value of the current is required.

Chemists, who have an understanding of the variations of these properties, have been able to use this knowledge to solve a wide variety of technical challenges. For example, silicon and other semiconductors form the backbone of modern electronics because of our ability to fine-tune the electrical properties of these materials. This chapter explores important properties of representative metals, metalloids, and nonmetals in the periodic table.

988 Chapter 18 | Representative Metals, Metalloids, and Nonmetals 18.1 Periodicity By the end of this section, you will be able to: Classify elements • Make predictions about the periodicity properties of the representative elements • We begin this section by examining the behaviors of representative metals in relation to their positions in the periodic table. The primary focus of this section will be the application of periodicity to the representative metals. It is possible to divide elements into groups according to their electron configurations. The representative elements are elements where the s and p orbitals are filling. The transition elements are elements where the d orbitals (groups 3–11 on the periodic table) are filling, and the inner transition metals are the elements where the f orbitals are filling. The d orbitals fill with the elements in group 11; therefore, the elements in group 12 qualify as representative elements because the last electron enters an s orbital. Metals among the representative elements are the representative metals. Metallic character results from an element’s ability to lose its outer valence electrons and results in high thermal and electrical conductivity, among other physical and chemical properties. There are 20 nonradioactive representative Figure 18.2). metals in groups 1, 2, 3, 12, 13, 14, and 15 of the periodic table (the elements shaded in yellow in The radioactive elements copernicium, flerovium, polonium, and livermorium are also metals but are beyond the scope of this chapter. In addition to the representative metals, some of the representative elements are metalloids. A metalloid is an element that has properties that are between those of metals and nonmetals; these elements are typically semiconductors. The remaining representative elements are nonmetals. Unlike metals, which typically form cations and ionic compounds (containing ionic bonds), nonmetals tend to form anions or molecular compounds. In general, the combination of a metal and a nonmetal produces a salt. A salt is an ionic compound consisting of cations and anions. https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

Chapter 18 | Representative Metals, Metalloids, and Nonmetals 989 Figure 18.2 The location of the representative metals is shown in the periodic table. Nonmetals are shown in green, metalloids in purple, and the transition metals and inner transition metals in yellow. Most of the representative metals do not occur naturally in an uncombined state because they readily react with water and oxygen in the air. However, it is possible to isolate elemental beryllium, magnesium, zinc, cadmium, mercury, aluminum, tin, and lead from their naturally occurring minerals and use them because they react very slowly with air. Part of the reason why these elements react slowly is that these elements react with air to form a protective coating. The formation of this protective coating is passivation. The coating is a nonreactive film of oxide or some other compound. Elemental magnesium, aluminum, zinc, and tin are important in the fabrication of many familiar items, including wire, cookware, foil, and many household and personal objects. Although beryllium, cadmium, mercury, and lead are readily available, there are limitations in their use because of their toxicity. Group 1: The Alkali Metals The alkali metals lithium, sodium, potassium, rubidium, cesium, and francium constitute group 1 of the periodic table. Although hydrogen is in group 1 (and also in group 17), it is a nonmetal and deserves separate consideration later in this chapter. The name alkali metal is in reference to the fact that these metals and their oxides react with water to form very basic (alkaline) solutions. 

--- Page 998 ---
990 Chapter 18 | Representative Metals, Metalloids, and Nonmetals The properties of the alkali metals are similar to each other as expected for elements in the same family. The alkali metals have the largest atomic radii and the lowest first ionization energy in their periods. This combination makes it very easy to remove the single electron in the outermost (valence) shell of each. The easy loss of this valence electron means that these metals readily form stable cations with a charge of 1+. Their reactivity increases with increasing atomic number due to the ease of losing the lone valence electron (decreasing ionization energy). Since oxidation is so easy, the reverse, reduction, is difficult, which explains why it is hard to isolate the elements. The solid alkali g/cm3). Figure 18.3, metals are very soft; lithium, shown in has the lowest density of any metal (0.5 The alkali metals all react vigorously with water to form hydrogen gas and a basic solution of the metal hydroxide. This means they are easier to oxidize than is hydrogen. As an example, the reaction of lithium with water is: 2Li(s) + 2H2 O(l) ⟶2LiOH(aq) + H2(g) Figure 18.3 Lithium floats in paraffin oil because its density is less than the density of paraffin oil. Alkali metals react directly with all the nonmetals (except the noble gases) to yield binary ionic compounds containing 1+ metal ions. These metals are so reactive that it is necessary to avoid contact with both moisture and Figure 18.4, oxygen in the air. Therefore, they are stored in sealed containers under mineral oil, as shown in to prevent contact with air and moisture. The pure metals never exist free (uncombined) in nature due to their high reactivity. In addition, this high reactivity makes it necessary to prepare the metals by electrolysis of alkali metal compounds. https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

(credit: http://images-of-elements.com/potassium.php) Unlike many other metals, the reactivity and softness of the alkali metals make these metals unsuitable for structural applications. However, there are applications where the reactivity of the alkali metals is an advantage. For example, the production of metals such as titanium and zirconium relies, in part, on the ability of sodium to reduce compounds of these metals. The manufacture of many organic compounds, including certain dyes, drugs, and perfumes, utilizes reduction by lithium or sodium. Figure 18.5. Sodium and its compounds impart a bright yellow color to a flame, as seen in Passing an electrical discharge through sodium vapor also produces this color. In both cases, this is an example of an emission spectrum as discussed in the chapter on electronic structure. Streetlights sometime employ sodium vapor lights because the sodium vapor penetrates fog better than most other light. This is because the fog does not scatter yellow light as much as it scatters white light. The other alkali metals and their salts also impart color to a flame. Lithium creates a bright, crimson color, whereas the others create a pale, violet color.

Link to Learning This video (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/16alkalih2o) demonstrates the reactions of the alkali metals with water. Group 2: The Alkaline Earth Metals The alkaline earth metals (beryllium, magnesium, calcium, strontium, barium, and radium) constitute group 2 of the periodic table. The name alkaline metal comes from the fact that the oxides of the heavier members of the group react with water to form alkaline solutions. The nuclear charge increases when going from group 1 to group 2. Because of this charge increase, the atoms of the alkaline earth metals are smaller and have higher first ionization energies than the alkali metals within the same period. The higher ionization energy makes the alkaline earth metals less reactive than the alkali metals; however, they are still very reactive elements. Their reactivity increases, as expected, with increasing size and decreasing ionization energy. In chemical reactions, these metals readily lose both valence electrons to form compounds in which they exhibit an oxidation state of 2+. Due to their high reactivity, it is common https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

Chapter 18 | Representative Metals, Metalloids, and Nonmetals 993 to produce the alkaline earth metals, like the alkali metals, by electrolysis. Even though the ionization energies are low, the two metals with the highest ionization energies (beryllium and magnesium) do form compounds that exhibit some covalent characters. Like the alkali metals, the heavier alkaline earth metals impart color to a flame. As in the case of the alkali metals, this is part of the emission spectrum of these elements. Calcium and strontium produce shades of red, whereas barium produces a green color. Magnesium is a silver-white metal that is malleable and ductile at high temperatures. Passivation decreases the reactivity of magnesium metal. Upon exposure to air, a tightly adhering layer of magnesium oxycarbonate forms on the surface of the metal and inhibits further reaction. (The carbonate comes from the reaction of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.) Magnesium is the lightest of the widely used structural metals, which is why most magnesium production is for lightweight alloys. Figure 18.6), Magnesium (shown in calcium, strontium, and barium react with water and air. At room temperature, barium shows the most vigorous reaction. The products of the reaction with water are hydrogen and the metal hydroxide. The formation of hydrogen gas indicates that the heavier alkaline earth metals are better reducing agents (more easily oxidized) than is hydrogen. As expected, these metals react with both acids and nonmetals to form ionic compounds. Unlike most salts of the alkali metals, many of the common salts of the alkaline earth metals are insoluble in water because of the high lattice energies of these compounds, containing a divalent metal ion. Figure 18.6 From left to right: Mg(s), warm water at pH 7, and the resulting solution with a pH greater than 7, as indicated by the pink color of the phenolphthalein indicator. (credit: modification of work by Sahar Atwa) The potent reducing power of hot magnesium is useful in preparing some metals from their oxides. Indeed, magnesium’s affinity for oxygen is so great that burning magnesium reacts with carbon dioxide, producing elemental carbon: 2Mg(s) + CO2(g) ⟶2MgO(s) + C(s) For this reason, a CO2 fire extinguisher will not extinguish a magnesium fire. Additionally, the brilliant white light emitted by burning magnesium makes it useful in flares and fireworks. Group 12 The elements in group 12 are not transition elements because the last electron added is not a d electron, but an s electron. Since the last electron added is an s electron, these elements qualify as representative metals, or post- transition metals. The group 12 elements behave more like the alkaline earth metals than transition metals. Group 12 contains the four elements zinc, cadmium, mercury, and copernicium. Each of these elements has two electrons in its (ns2). outer shell When atoms of these metals form cations with a charge of 2+, where the two outer electrons are lost,

994 Chapter 18 | Representative Metals, Metalloids, and Nonmetals they have pseudo-noble gas electron configurations. Mercury is sometimes an exception because it also exhibits an 2+ Hg2 oxidation state of 1+ in compounds that contain a diatomic ion. In their elemental forms and in compounds, cadmium and mercury are both toxic. Zinc is the most reactive in group 12, and mercury is the least reactive. (This is the reverse of the reactivity trend of the metals of groups 1 and 2, in which reactivity increases down a group. The increase in reactivity with increasing atomic number only occurs for the metals in groups 1 and 2.) The decreasing reactivity is due to the formation of ions with a pseudo-noble gas configuration and to other factors that are beyond the scope of this discussion. The chemical behaviors of zinc and cadmium are quite similar to each other but differ from that of mercury. Zinc and cadmium have lower reduction potentials than hydrogen, and, like the alkali metals and alkaline earth metals, they will produce hydrogen gas when they react with acids. The reaction of zinc with hydrochloric acid, Figure 18.7, shown in is: Zn2+(aq) 2Cl−(aq) O+(aq) 2Cl−(aq) + + 2H2 O(l) Zn(s) + 2H3 + ⟶H2(g) + Zn2+ Figure 18.7 Zinc is an active transition metal. It dissolves in hydrochloric acid, forming a solution of colorless Cl– ions, ions, and hydrogen gas. Zinc is a silvery metal that quickly tarnishes to a blue-gray appearance. This change in color is due to an adherent coating of a basic carbonate, Zn2(OH)2CO3, which passivates the metal to inhibit further corrosion. Dry cell and alkaline batteries contain a zinc anode. Brass (Cu and Zn) and some bronze (Cu, Sn, and sometimes Zn) are important zinc alloys. About half of zinc production serves to protect iron and other metals from corrosion. This protection may take the form of a sacrificial anode (also known as a galvanic anode, which is a means of providing cathodic protection for various metals) or as a thin coating on the protected metal. Galvanized steel is steel with a protective coating of zinc. Chemistry in Everyday Life Sacrificial Anodes A sacrificial anode, or galvanic anode, is a means of providing cathodic protection of various metals. Cathodic protection refers to the prevention of corrosion by converting the corroding metal into a cathode. As a cathode, the metal resists corrosion, which is an oxidation process. Corrosion occurs at the sacrificial anode instead of at the cathode. https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at 

--- Page 1003 ---
Chapter 18 | Representative Metals, Metalloids, and Nonmetals 995 The construction of such a system begins with the attachment of a more active metal (more negative reduction potential) to the metal needing protection. Attachment may be direct or via a wire. To complete the circuit, a salt bridge is necessary. This salt bridge is often seawater or ground water. Once the circuit is complete, oxidation (corrosion) occurs at the anode and not the cathode. The commonly used sacrificial anodes are magnesium, aluminum, and zinc. Magnesium has the most negative reduction potential of the three and serves best when the salt bridge is less efficient due to a low electrolyte concentration such as in freshwater. Zinc and aluminum work better in saltwater than does magnesium. Aluminum is lighter than zinc and has a higher capacity; however, an oxide coating may passivate the aluminum. In special cases, other materials are useful. For example, iron will protect copper. Mercury is very different from zinc and cadmium. Mercury is the only metal that is liquid at 25 °C. Many metals dissolve in mercury, forming solutions called amalgams (see the feature on Amalgams), which are alloys of mercury Figure 18.8, with one or more other metals. Mercury, shown in is a nonreactive element that is more difficult to oxidize than hydrogen. Thus, it does not displace hydrogen from acids; however, it will react with strong oxidizing acids, such as nitric acid: Hg(l) + HCl(aq) ⟶no reaction 3Hg(l) + 8HNO3(aq) ⟶3Hg(NO3)2(aq) + 4H2 O(l) + 2NO(g) The clear NO initially formed quickly undergoes further oxidation to the reddish brown NO2. Figure 18.8 From left to right: Hg(l), Hg + concentrated HCl, Hg + concentrated HNO3. (credit: Sahar Atwa) Most mercury compounds decompose when heated. Most mercury compounds contain mercury with a 2+-oxidation 2+ Hg2 state. When there is a large excess of mercury, it is possible to form compounds containing the ion. All mercury compounds are toxic, and it is necessary to exercise great care in their synthesis. Chemistry in Everyday Life

996 Chapter 18 | Representative Metals, Metalloids, and Nonmetals Amalgams An amalgam is an alloy of mercury with one or more other metals. This is similar to considering steel to be an alloy of iron with other metals. Most metals will form an amalgam with mercury, with the main exceptions being iron, platinum, tungsten, and tantalum. Due to toxicity issues with mercury, there has been a significant decrease in the use of amalgams. Historically, amalgams were important in electrolytic cells and in the extraction of gold. Amalgams of the alkali metals still find use because they are strong reducing agents and easier to handle than the pure alkali metals. Prospectors had a problem when they found finely divided gold. They learned that adding mercury to their pans collected the gold into the mercury to form an amalgam for easier collection. Unfortunately, losses of small amounts of mercury over the years left many streams in California polluted with mercury. Dentists use amalgams containing silver and other metals to fill cavities. There are several reasons to use an amalgam including low cost, ease of manipulation, and longevity compared to alternate materials. Dental amalgams are approximately 50% mercury by weight, which, in recent years, has become a concern due to the toxicity of mercury. After reviewing the best available data, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) considers amalgam-based fillings to be safe for adults and children over six years of age. Even with multiple fillings, the mercury levels in the patients remain far below the lowest levels associated with harm. Clinical studies have found no link between dental amalgams and health problems. Health issues may not be the same in cases of children under six or pregnant women. The FDA conclusions are in line with the opinions of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Centers for Disease Control (CDC). The only health consideration noted is that some people are allergic to the amalgam or one of its components. Group 13 Group 13 contains the metalloid boron and the metals aluminum, gallium, indium, and thallium. The lightest element, boron, is semiconducting, and its binary compounds tend to be covalent and not ionic. The remaining elements of the group are metals, but their oxides and hydroxides change characters. The oxides and hydroxides of aluminum and gallium exhibit both acidic and basic behaviors. A substance, such as these two, that will react with both acids and bases is amphoteric. This characteristic illustrates the combination of nonmetallic and metallic behaviors of these two elements. Indium and thallium oxides and hydroxides exhibit only basic behavior, in accordance with the clearly metallic character of these two elements. The melting point of gallium is unusually low (about 30 °C) and will melt in your hand. Aluminum is amphoteric because it will react with both acids and bases. A typical reaction with an acid is: 6HCl(aq) ⟶2AlCl3(aq) 3H2(g) 2Al(s) + + The products of the reaction of aluminum with a base depend upon the reaction conditions, with the following being one possibility: ⎡ ⎤ ⎣Al(OH)4 2Al(s) + 2NaOH(aq) + 6H2 O(l) ⟶2Na ⎦(aq) + 3H2(g) With both acids and bases, the reaction with aluminum generates hydrogen gas. ns2np1. The group 13 elements have a valence shell electron configuration of Aluminum normally uses all of its valence electrons when it reacts, giving compounds in which it has an oxidation state of 3+.

The pair of electrons is the valence s orbital for those elements. In general, the inert pair effect is important for the lower Tl+(aq) Tl3+(aq). p-block elements. In an aqueous solution, the ion is more stable than is In general, these metals will react with air and water to form 3+ ions; however, thallium reacts to give thallium(I) derivatives. The metals of group 13 all react directly with nonmetals such as sulfur, phosphorus, and the halogens, forming binary compounds. The metals of group 13 (Al, Ga, In, and Tl) are all reactive. However, passivation occurs as a tough, hard, thin film of the metal oxide forms upon exposure to air. Disruption of this film may counter the passivation, allowing the metal to react. One way to disrupt the film is to expose the passivated metal to mercury. Some of the metal dissolves in the mercury to form an amalgam, which sheds the protective oxide layer to expose the metal to further reaction. The formation of an amalgam allows the metal to react with air and water. Link to Learning Although easily oxidized, the passivation of aluminum makes it very useful as a strong, lightweight building material. Because of the formation of an amalgam, mercury is corrosive to structural materials made of aluminum. This video (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/16aluminumhg) demonstrates how the integrity of an aluminum beam can be destroyed by the addition of a small amount of elemental mercury. The most important uses of aluminum are in the construction and transportation industries, and in the manufacture of aluminum cans and aluminum foil. These uses depend on the lightness, toughness, and strength of the metal, as well as its resistance to corrosion. Because aluminum is an excellent conductor of heat and resists corrosion, it is useful in the manufacture of cooking utensils. Aluminum is a very good reducing agent and may replace other reducing agents in the isolation of certain metals from their oxides. Although more expensive than reduction by carbon, aluminum is important in the isolation of Mo, W, and Cr from their oxides. Group 14 The metallic members of group 14 are tin, lead, and flerovium. Carbon is a typical nonmetal. The remaining elements of the group, silicon and germanium, are examples of semimetals or metalloids. Tin and lead form the stable divalent Sn2+ Pb2+, cations, and with oxidation states two below the group oxidation state of 4+. The stability of this oxidation state is a consequence of the inert pair effect. Tin and lead also form covalent compounds with a formal 4+-oxidation state. For example, SnCl4 and PbCl4 are low-boiling covalent liquids.

998 Chapter 18 | Representative Metals, Metalloids, and Nonmetals Figure 18.9 (a) Tin(II) chloride is an ionic solid; (b) tin(IV) chloride is a covalent liquid. Tin reacts readily with nonmetals and acids to form tin(II) compounds (indicating that it is more easily oxidized than Figure 18.9), hydrogen) and with nonmetals to form either tin(II) or tin(IV) compounds (shown in depending on the stoichiometry and reaction conditions. Lead is less reactive. It is only slightly easier to oxidize than hydrogen, and oxidation normally requires a hot concentrated acid. Many of these elements exist as allotropes. Allotropes are two or more forms of the same element in the same physical state with different chemical and physical properties. There are two common allotropes of tin. These allotropes are grey (brittle) tin and white tin. As with other allotropes, the difference between these forms of tin is in the arrangement of the atoms. White tin is stable above 13.2 °C and is malleable like other metals. At low temperatures, gray tin is the more stable form. Gray tin is brittle and tends to break down to a powder. Consequently, articles made of tin will disintegrate in cold weather, particularly if the cold spell is lengthy. The change progresses slowly from the spot of origin, and the gray tin that is first formed catalyzes further change. In a way, this effect is similar to the spread of an infection in a plant or animal body, leading people to call this process tin disease or tin pest. The principal use of tin is in the coating of steel to form tin plate-sheet iron, which constitutes the tin in tin cans. Important tin alloys are bronze (Cu and Sn) and solder (Sn and Pb). Lead is important in the lead storage batteries in automobiles. Group 15 Bismuth, the heaviest member of group 15, is a less reactive metal than the other representative metals. It readily Bi3+. gives up three of its five valence electrons to active nonmetals to form the tri-positive ion, It forms compounds with the group oxidation state of 5+ only when treated with strong oxidizing agents. The stability of the 3+-oxidation state is another example of the inert pair effect. 18.2 Occurrence and Preparation of the Representative Metals By the end of this section, you will be able to: Identify natural sources of representative metals • Describe electrolytic and chemical reduction processes used to prepare these elements from natural • sources https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

Chapter 18 | Representative Metals, Metalloids, and Nonmetals 999 Because of their reactivity, we do not find most representative metals as free elements in nature. However, compounds that contain ions of most representative metals are abundant. In this section, we will consider the two common techniques used to isolate the metals from these compounds—electrolysis and chemical reduction. These metals primarily occur in minerals, with lithium found in silicate or phosphate minerals, and sodium and potassium found in salt deposits from evaporation of ancient seas and in silicates. The alkaline earth metals occur as silicates and, with the exception of beryllium, as carbonates and sulfates. Beryllium occurs as the mineral beryl, Be3Al2Si6O18, which, with certain impurities, may be either the gemstone emerald or aquamarine. Magnesium is in seawater and, along with the heavier alkaline earth metals, occurs as silicates, carbonates, and sulfates. Aluminum occurs abundantly in many types of clay and in bauxite, an impure aluminum oxide hydroxide. The principle tin ore is the oxide cassiterite, SnO2, and the principle lead and thallium ores are the sulfides or the products of weathering of the sulfides. The remaining representative metals occur as impurities in zinc or aluminum ores. Electrolysis Ions of metals in of groups 1 and 2, along with aluminum, are very difficult to reduce; therefore, it is necessary to prepare these elements by electrolysis, an important process discussed in the chapter on electrochemistry. Briefly, electrolysis involves using electrical energy to drive unfavorable chemical reactions to completion; it is useful in the isolation of reactive metals in their pure forms. Sodium, aluminum, and magnesium are typical examples. The Preparation of Sodium The most important method for the production of sodium is the electrolysis of molten sodium chloride; the set-up is a Figure 18.10. Downs cell, shown in The reaction involved in this process is: electrolysis ⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯ → 2NaCl(l) 2Na(l) + Cl2(g) 600 °C The electrolysis cell contains molten sodium chloride (melting point 801 °C), to which calcium chloride has been added to lower the melting point to 600 °C (a colligative effect). The passage of a direct current through the cell causes the sodium ions to migrate to the negatively charged cathode and pick up electrons, reducing the ions to sodium metal. Chloride ions migrate to the positively charged anode, lose electrons, and undergo oxidation to chlorine gas. The overall cell reaction comes from adding the following reactions: 2Na+ 2e−⟶2Na(l) at the cathode: + 2e− 2Cl−⟶Cl2(g) + at the anode: 2Na+ 2Cl−⟶2Na(l) overall change: + + Cl2(g) Separation of the molten sodium and chlorine prevents recombination. The liquid sodium, which is less dense than molten sodium chloride, floats to the surface and flows into a collector. The gaseous chlorine goes to storage tanks. Chlorine is also a valuable product.

1000 Chapter 18 | Representative Metals, Metalloids, and Nonmetals Figure 18.10 Pure sodium metal is isolated by electrolysis of molten sodium chloride using a Downs cell. It is not possible to isolate sodium by electrolysis of aqueous solutions of sodium salts because hydrogen ions are more easily reduced than are sodium ions; as a result, hydrogen gas forms at the cathode instead of the desired sodium metal. The high temperature required to melt NaCl means that liquid sodium metal forms. The Preparation of Aluminum The preparation of aluminum utilizes a process invented in 1886 by Charles M. Hall, who began to work on the problem while a student at Oberlin College in Ohio. Paul L. T. Héroult discovered the process independently a month or two later in France. In honor to the two inventors, this electrolysis cell is known as the Hall–Héroult cell. The Figure 18.11 Hall–Héroult cell is an electrolysis cell for the production of aluminum. illustrates the Hall–Héroult cell. The production of aluminum begins with the purification of bauxite, the most common source of aluminum. The reaction of bauxite, AlO(OH), with hot sodium hydroxide forms soluble sodium aluminate, while clay and other impurities remain undissolved: ⟶Na[Al(OH)4](aq) AlO(OH)(s) + NaOH(aq) + H2 O(l) After the removal of the impurities by filtration, the addition of acid to the aluminate leads to the reprecipitation of aluminum hydroxide: O+(aq) Na+(aq) Na[Al(OH)4](aq) + H3 ⟶Al(OH)3(s) + + 2H2 O(l) The next step is to remove the precipitated aluminum hydroxide by filtration. Heating the hydroxide produces aluminum oxide, Al2O3, which dissolves in a molten mixture of cryolite, Na3AlF6, and calcium fluoride, CaF2. Figure 18.11. Electrolysis of this solution takes place in a cell like that shown in Reduction of aluminum ions to the metal occurs at the cathode, while oxygen, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide form at the anode. https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at 

--- Page 1009 ---
Chapter 18 | Representative Metals, Metalloids, and Nonmetals 1001 Figure 18.11 An electrolytic cell is used for the production of aluminum. The electrolysis of a solution of cryolite and calcium fluoride results in aluminum metal at the cathode, and oxygen, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide at the anode. The Preparation of Magnesium Magnesium is the other metal that is isolated in large quantities by electrolysis. Seawater, which contains approximately 0.5% magnesium chloride, serves as the major source of magnesium. Addition of calcium hydroxide to seawater precipitates magnesium hydroxide. The addition of hydrochloric acid to magnesium hydroxide, followed by evaporation of the resultant aqueous solution, leaves pure magnesium chloride. The electrolysis of molten magnesium chloride forms liquid magnesium and chlorine gas: MgCl2(aq) + Ca(OH)2(aq) ⟶Mg(OH)2(s) + CaCl2(aq) 2HCl(aq) ⟶MgCl2(aq) + 2H2 O(l) Mg(OH)2(s) + MgCl2(l) ⟶Mg(l) + Cl2(g) Some production facilities have moved away from electrolysis completely. In the next section, we will see how the Pidgeon process leads to the chemical reduction of magnesium. Chemical Reduction It is possible to isolate many of the representative metals by chemical reduction using other elements as reducing agents. In general, chemical reduction is much less expensive than electrolysis, and for this reason, chemical reduction is the method of choice for the isolation of these elements. For example, it is possible to produce potassium, rubidium, and cesium by chemical reduction, as it is possible to reduce the molten chlorides of these metals with sodium metal. This may be surprising given that these metals are more reactive than sodium; however, the metals formed are more volatile than sodium and can be distilled for collection. The removal of the metal vapor leads to a shift in the

1002 Chapter 18 | Representative Metals, Metalloids, and Nonmetals equilibrium to produce more metal (see how reactions can be driven in the discussions of Le Châtelier’s principle in the chapter on fundamental equilibrium concepts). The production of magnesium, zinc, and tin provide additional examples of chemical reduction. The Preparation of Magnesium The Pidgeon process involves the reaction of magnesium oxide with elemental silicon at high temperatures to form pure magnesium: ⎯⎯Δ Si(s) + 2MgO(s) SiO2(s) + 2Mg(g) → Although this reaction is unfavorable in terms of thermodynamics, the removal of the magnesium vapor produced takes advantage of Le Châtelier’s principle to continue the forward progress of the reaction. Over 75% of the world’s production of magnesium, primarily in China, comes from this process. The Preparation of Zinc Zinc ores usually contain zinc sulfide, zinc oxide, or zinc carbonate. After separation of these compounds from the ores, heating in air converts the ore to zinc oxide by one of the following reactions: ⎯⎯Δ 2ZnS(s) + 3O2(g) 2ZnO(s) + 2SO2(g) → ⎯⎯Δ ZnCO3(s) ZnO(s) + Co2(g) → Carbon, in the form of coal, reduces the zinc oxide to form zinc vapor: ZnO(s) + C(s) ⟶Zn(g) + CO(g) The zinc can be distilled (boiling point 907 °C) and condensed. This zinc contains impurities of cadmium (767 °C), iron (2862 °C), lead (1750 °C), and arsenic (613 °C). Careful redistillation produces pure zinc. Arsenic and cadmium are distilled from the zinc because they have lower boiling points. At higher temperatures, the zinc is distilled from the other impurities, mainly lead and iron. The Preparation of Tin The ready reduction of tin(IV) oxide by the hot coals of a campfire accounts for the knowledge of tin in the ancient world. In the modern process, the roasting of tin ores containing SnO2 removes contaminants such as arsenic and sulfur as volatile oxides. Treatment of the remaining material with hydrochloric acid removes the oxides of other metals. Heating the purified ore with carbon at temperature above 1000 °C produces tin: ⎯⎯Δ 2CO(g) SnO2(s) + 2C(s) Sn(s) + → The molten tin collects at the bottom of the furnace and is drawn off and cast into blocks. 18.3 Structure and General Properties of the Metalloids By the end of this section, you will be able to: Describe the general preparation, properties, and uses of the metalloids • Describe the preparation, properties, and compounds of boron and silicon • A series of six elements called the metalloids separate the metals from the nonmetals in the periodic table. The metalloids are boron, silicon, germanium, arsenic, antimony, and tellurium. These elements look metallic; however, they do not conduct electricity as well as metals so they are semiconductors. They are semiconductors because their electrons are more tightly bound to their nuclei than are those of metallic conductors. Their chemical behavior falls https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at 

--- Page 1011 ---
Chapter 18 | Representative Metals, Metalloids, and Nonmetals 1003 between that of metals and nonmetals. For example, the pure metalloids form covalent crystals like the nonmetals, but like the metals, they generally do not form monatomic anions. This intermediate behavior is in part due to their intermediate electronegativity values. In this section, we will briefly discuss the chemical behavior of metalloids and deal with two of these elements—boron and silicon—in more detail. The metalloid boron exhibits many similarities to its neighbor carbon and its diagonal neighbor silicon. All three 2s22p1 elements form covalent compounds. However, boron has one distinct difference in that its outer electron structure gives it one less valence electron than it has valence orbitals. Although boron exhibits an oxidation state of 3+ in most of its stable compounds, this electron deficiency provides boron with the ability to form other, sometimes fractional, oxidation states, which occur, for example, in the boron hydrides. 3s23p2, Silicon has the valence shell electron configuration and it commonly forms tetrahedral structures in which sp3 it is hybridized with a formal oxidation state of 4+. The major differences between the chemistry of carbon and silicon result from the relative strength of the carbon-carbon bond, carbon’s ability to form stable bonds to itself, and the presence of the empty 3d valence-shell orbitals in silicon. Silicon’s empty d orbitals and boron’s empty p orbital enable tetrahedral silicon compounds and trigonal planar boron compounds to act as Lewis acids. Carbon, on the other hand, has no available valence shell orbitals; tetrahedral carbon compounds cannot act as Lewis acids. Germanium is very similar to silicon in its chemical behavior. Arsenic and antimony generally form compounds in which an oxidation state of 3+ or 5+ is exhibited; however, arsenic can form arsenides with an oxidation state of 3−. These elements tarnish only slightly in dry air but readily oxidize when warmed. Tellurium combines directly with most elements. The most stable tellurium compounds are the tellurides—salts of Te2−formed with active metals and lanthanides—and compounds with oxygen, fluorine, and chlorine, in which tellurium normally exhibits an oxidation state 2+ or 4+. Although tellurium(VI) compounds are known (for example, TeF6), there is a marked resistance to oxidation to this maximum group oxidation state. Structures of the Metalloids Covalent bonding is the key to the crystal structures of the metalloids. In this regard, these elements resemble nonmetals in their behavior. Elemental silicon, germanium, arsenic, antimony, and tellurium are lustrous, metallic-looking solids. Silicon and germanium crystallize with a diamond structure. Each atom within the crystal has covalent bonds to four neighboring atoms at the corners of a regular tetrahedron. Single crystals of silicon and germanium are giant, three-dimensional molecules. There are several allotropes of arsenic with the most stable being layer like and containing puckered sheets of arsenic atoms. Each arsenic atom forms covalent bonds to three other atoms within the sheet. The crystal structure Figure 18.12. of antimony is similar to that of arsenic, both shown in The structures of arsenic and antimony are similar to the structure of graphite, covered later in this chapter. Tellurium forms crystals that contain infinite spiral chains of tellurium atoms. Each atom in the chain bonds to two other atoms.

1004 Chapter 18 | Representative Metals, Metalloids, and Nonmetals Figure 18.12 (a) Arsenic and (b) antimony have a layered structure similar to that of (c) graphite, except that the layers are puckered rather than planar. (d) Elemental tellurium forms spiral chains. Figure 18.13, Pure crystalline boron is transparent. The crystals consist of icosahedra, as shown in with a boron atom at each corner. In the most common form of boron, the icosahedra pack together in a manner similar to the cubic closest packing of spheres. All boron-boron bonds within each icosahedron are identical and are approximately 176 pm in length. In the different forms of boron, there are different arrangements and connections between the icosahedra. Figure 18.13 An icosahedron is a symmetrical, solid shape with 20 faces, each of which is an equilateral triangle. The faces meet at 12 corners. The name silicon is derived from the Latin word for flint, silex. The metalloid silicon readily forms compounds containing Si-O-Si bonds, which are of prime importance in the mineral world. This bonding capability is in contrast to the nonmetal carbon, whose ability to form carbon-carbon bonds gives it prime importance in the plant and animal worlds. Occurrence, Preparation, and Compounds of Boron and Silicon Boron constitutes less than 0.001% by weight of the earth’s crust. In nature, it only occurs in compounds with oxygen. Boron is widely distributed in volcanic regions as boric acid, B(OH)3, and in dry lake regions, including the desert Na2B4O7⋅10H2O. areas of California, as borates and salts of boron oxyacids, such as borax, inert at room temperature, reacting with only fluorine and oxygen to form boron Elemental boron is chemically trifluoride, BF3, and boric oxide, B2O3, respectively. At higher temperatures, boron reacts with all nonmetals, except tellurium and the noble gases, and with nearly all metals; it oxidizes to B2O3 when heated with concentrated nitric or https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

Chapter 18 | Representative Metals, Metalloids, and Nonmetals 1005 sulfuric acid. Boron does not react with nonoxidizing acids. Many boron compounds react readily with water to give boric acid, B(OH)3 (sometimes written as H3BO3). Reduction of boric oxide with magnesium powder forms boron (95–98.5% pure) as a brown, amorphous powder: B2 O3(s) + 3Mg(s) ⟶2B(s) + 3MgO(s) An amorphous substance is a material that appears to be a solid, but does not have a long-range order like a true solid. Treatment with hydrochloric acid removes the magnesium oxide. Further purification of the boron begins with conversion of the impure boron into boron trichloride. The next step is to heat a mixture of boron trichloride and hydrogen: 1500 °C + 6HCl(g) ΔH° = 253.7 kJ 2BCl3(g) + 3H2(g) ⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯ → 2B(s) Silicon makes up nearly one-fourth of the mass of the earth’s crust—second in abundance only to oxygen. The crust is composed almost entirely of minerals in which the silicon atoms are at the center of the silicon-oxygen tetrahedron, which connect in a variety of ways to produce, among other things, chains, layers, and three-dimensional frameworks. These minerals constitute the bulk of most common rocks, soil, and clays. In addition, materials such as bricks, ceramics, and glasses contain silicon compounds. It is possible to produce silicon by the high-temperature reduction of silicon dioxide with strong reducing agents, such as carbon and magnesium: ⎯⎯Δ SiO2(s) + 2C(s) Si(s) + 2CO(g) → ⎯⎯Δ SiO2(s) + 2Mg(s) Si(s) + 2MgO(s) → Extremely pure silicon is necessary for the manufacture of semiconductor electronic devices. This process begins with the conversion of impure silicon into silicon tetrahalides, or silane (SiH4), followed by decomposition at high Figure 18.14, temperatures. Zone refining, illustrated in completes the purification. In this method, a rod of silicon is heated at one end by a heat source that produces a thin cross-section of molten silicon. Slowly lowering the rod through the heat source moves the molten zone from one end of the rod to other. As this thin, molten region moves, impurities in the silicon dissolve in the liquid silicon and move with the molten region. Ultimately, the impurities move to one end of the rod, which is then cut off.

1006 Chapter 18 | Representative Metals, Metalloids, and Nonmetals Figure 18.14 A zone-refining apparatus used to purify silicon. This highly purified silicon, containing no more than one part impurity per million parts of silicon, is the most important element in the computer industry. Pure silicon is necessary in semiconductor electronic devices such as transistors, computer chips, and solar cells. Like some metals, passivation of silicon occurs due the formation of a very thin film of oxide (primarily silicon dioxide, SiO2). Silicon dioxide is soluble in hot aqueous base; thus, strong bases destroy the passivation. Removal of the passivation layer allows the base to dissolve the silicon, forming hydrogen gas and silicate anions. For example: 4OH−(aq) 4−(aq) Si(s) + ⟶SiO4 + 2H2(g) Silicon reacts with halogens at high temperatures, forming volatile tetrahalides, such as SiF4. Unlike carbon, silicon does not readily form double or triple bonds. Silicon compounds of the general formula SiX4, where X is a highly electronegative group, can act as Lewis acids to form six-coordinate silicon. For example, silicon ⎡ ⎤ ⎦2−ion ⎣SiF6 tetrafluoride, SiF4, reacts with sodium fluoride to yield Na2[SiF6], which contains the octahedral in sp3d2 which silicon is hybridized: 2NaF(s) + SiF4(g) ⟶Na2 SiF6(s) Antimony reacts readily with stoichiometric amounts of fluorine, chlorine, bromine, or iodine, yielding trihalides or, with excess fluorine or chlorine, forming the pentahalides SbF5 and SbCl5. Depending on the stoichiometry, it forms antimony(III) sulfide, Sb2S3, or antimony(V) sulfide when heated with sulfur. As expected, the metallic nature of the element is greater than that of arsenic, which lies immediately above it in group 15. https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

Chapter 18 | Representative Metals, Metalloids, and Nonmetals 1007 Boron and Silicon Halides Boron trihalides—BF3, BCl3, BBr3, and BI3—can be prepared by the direct reaction of the elements. These nonpolar sp2 molecules contain boron with hybridization and a trigonal planar molecular geometry. The fluoride and chloride compounds are colorless gasses, the bromide is a liquid, and the iodide is a white crystalline solid. Except for boron trifluoride, the boron trihalides readily hydrolyze in water to form boric acid and the corresponding hydrohalic acid. Boron trichloride reacts according to the equation: ⟶B(OH)3(aq) + 3HCl(aq) BCl3(g) + 3H2 O(l) Boron trifluoride reacts with hydrofluoric acid, to yield a solution of fluoroboric acid, HBF4: O+(aq) −(aq) BF3(aq) + HF(aq) + H2 O(l) ⟶H3 + BF4 In this reaction, the BF3 molecule acts as the Lewis acid (electron pair acceptor) and accepts a pair of electrons from a fluoride ion: All the tetrahalides of silicon, SiX4, have been prepared. Silicon tetrachloride can be prepared by direct chlorination at elevated temperatures or by heating silicon dioxide with chlorine and carbon: ⎯⎯Δ SiO2(s) + 2C(s) + 2Cl2(g) SiCl4(g) + 2CO(g) → Silicon tetrachloride is a covalent tetrahedral molecule, which is a nonpolar, low-boiling (57 °C), colorless liquid. It is possible to prepare silicon tetrafluoride by the reaction of silicon dioxide with hydrofluoric acid: SiO2(s) + 4HF(g) ⟶SiF4(g) + 2H2 O(l) ΔH° = −191.2 kJ Hydrofluoric acid is the only common acid that will react with silicon dioxide or silicates. This reaction occurs because the silicon-fluorine bond is the only bond that silicon forms that is stronger than the silicon-oxygen bond. For this reason, it is possible to store all common acids, other than hydrofluoric acid, in glass containers. Except for silicon tetrafluoride, silicon halides are extremely sensitive to water. Upon exposure to water, SiCl4 reacts rapidly with hydroxide groups, replacing all four chlorine atoms to produce unstable orthosilicic acid, Si(OH)4 or H4SiO4, which slowly decomposes into SiO2. Boron and Silicon Oxides and Derivatives Boron burns at 700 °C in oxygen, forming boric oxide, B2O3. Boric oxide is necessary for the production of heat- Figure 18.15 resistant borosilicate glass, like that shown in and certain optical glasses. Boric oxide dissolves in hot water to form boric acid, B(OH)3: B2 O3(s) + 3H2 O(l) ⟶2B(OH)3(aq)

1008 Chapter 18 | Representative Metals, Metalloids, and Nonmetals Figure 18.15 Laboratory glassware, such as Pyrex and Kimax, is made of borosilicate glass because it does not break when heated. The inclusion of borates in the glass helps to mediate the effects of thermal expansion and contraction. This reduces the likelihood of thermal shock, which causes silicate glass to crack upon rapid heating or cooling.

In solid B(OH)3, hydrogen bonding holds these triangular units together. Boric acid, shown in 18.16, is a very weak acid that does not act as a proton donor but rather as a Lewis acid, accepting an unshared pair OH−: of electrons from the Lewis base 10−10 O+(aq) −(aq) ⇌B(OH)4 H3 Ka = 5.8 × + B(OH)3(aq) + 2H2 O(l) Figure 18.16 Boric acid has a planar structure with three –OH groups spread out equally at 120° angles from each other. Heating boric acid to 100 °C causes molecules of water to split out between pairs of adjacent –OH groups to form metaboric acid, HBO2. At about 150 °C, additional B-O-B linkages form, connecting the BO3 groups together with shared oxygen atoms to form tetraboric acid, H2B4O7. Complete water loss, at still higher temperatures, results in boric oxide. Borates are salts of the oxyacids of boron. Borates result from the reactions of a base with an oxyacid or from the fusion of boric acid or boric oxide with a metal oxide or hydroxide.

Figure 18.17 The borate anions are (a) CaB2O4, (b) and (c) The anion in CaB2O4 is an “infinite” chain. Silicon dioxide, silica, occurs in both crystalline and amorphous forms. The usual crystalline form of silicon dioxide is quartz, a hard, brittle, clear, colorless solid. It is useful in many ways—for architectural decorations, semiprecious jewels, and frequency control in radio transmitters. Silica takes many crystalline forms, or polymorphs, in nature. Fe3+ Trace amounts of in quartz give amethyst its characteristic purple color. The term quartz is also used for articles such as tubing and lenses that are manufactured from amorphous silica. Opal is a naturally occurring form of amorphous silica. The contrast in structure and physical properties between silicon dioxide and carbon dioxide is interesting, as Figure 18.18. illustrated in Solid carbon dioxide (dry ice) contains single CO2 molecules with each of the two oxygen atoms attached to the carbon atom by double bonds. Very weak intermolecular forces hold the molecules together in the crystal. The volatility of dry ice reflect these weak forces between molecules. In contrast, silicon dioxide is a covalent network solid. In silicon dioxide, each silicon atom links to four oxygen atoms by single bonds directed toward the corners of a regular tetrahedron, and SiO4 tetrahedra share oxygen atoms. This arrangement gives a three dimensional, continuous, silicon-oxygen network. A quartz crystal is a macromolecule of silicon dioxide. The difference between these two compounds is the ability of the group 14 elements to form strong π bonds. Second- period elements, such as carbon, form very strong π bonds, which is why carbon dioxide forms small molecules with strong double bonds. Elements below the second period, such as silicon, do not form π bonds as readily as second- period elements, and when they do form, the π bonds are weaker than those formed by second-period elements. For this reason, silicon dioxide does not contain π bonds but only σ bonds.

1010 Chapter 18 | Representative Metals, Metalloids, and Nonmetals Figure 18.18 Because carbon tends to form double and triple bonds and silicon does not, (a) carbon dioxide is a discrete molecule with two C=O double bonds and (b) silicon dioxide is an infinite network of oxygen atoms bridging between silicon atoms with each silicon atom possessing four Si-O single bonds. (credit a photo: modification of work by Erica Gerdes; credit b photo: modification of work by Didier Descouens) At 1600 °C, quartz melts to yield a viscous liquid. When the liquid cools, it does not crystallize readily but usually supercools and forms a glass, also called silica. The SiO4 tetrahedra in glassy silica have a random arrangement characteristic of supercooled liquids, and the glass has some very useful properties. Silica is highly transparent to both visible and ultraviolet light. For this reason, it is important in the manufacture of lamps that give radiation rich in ultraviolet light and in certain optical instruments that operate with ultraviolet light. The coefficient of expansion of silica glass is very low; therefore, rapid temperature changes do not cause it to fracture. CorningWare and other ceramic cookware contain amorphous silica. sp3-hybridized Silicates are salts containing anions composed of silicon and oxygen. In nearly all silicates, silicon atoms occur at the centers of tetrahedra with oxygen at the corners. There is a variation in the silicon-to-oxygen ratio that occurs because silicon-oxygen tetrahedra may exist as discrete, independent units or may share oxygen atoms at corners in a variety of ways. In addition, the presence of a variety of cations gives rise to the large number of silicate minerals. Many ceramics are composed of silicates. By including small amounts of other compounds, it is possible to modify the physical properties of the silicate materials to produce ceramics with useful characteristics. https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

Chapter 18 | Representative Metals, Metalloids, and Nonmetals 1011 18.4 Structure and General Properties of the Nonmetals By the end of this section, you will be able to: Describe structure and properties of nonmetals • The nonmetals are elements located in the upper right portion of the periodic table. Their properties and behavior are quite different from those of metals on the left side. Under normal conditions, more than half of the nonmetals are gases, one is a liquid, and the rest include some of the softest and hardest of solids. The nonmetals exhibit a rich variety of chemical behaviors. They include the most reactive and least reactive of elements, and they form many different ionic and covalent compounds. This section presents an overview of the properties and chemical behaviors of the nonmetals, as well as the chemistry of specific elements. Many of these nonmetals are important in biological systems. In many cases, trends in electronegativity enable us to predict the type of bonding and the physical states in compounds involving the nonmetals. We know that electronegativity decreases as we move down a given group and increases as we move from left to right across a period. The nonmetals have higher electronegativities than do metals, and compounds formed between metals and nonmetals are generally ionic in nature because of the large differences in electronegativity between them. The metals form cations, the nonmetals form anions, and the resulting compounds are solids under normal conditions. On the other hand, compounds formed between two or more nonmetals have small differences in electronegativity between the atoms, and covalent bonding—sharing of electrons—results. These substances tend to be molecular in nature and are gases, liquids, or volatile solids at room temperature and pressure. In normal chemical processes, nonmetals do not form monatomic positive ions (cations) because their ionization Cl−, energies are too high. All monatomic nonmetal ions are anions; examples include the chloride ion, the nitride N3−, Se2−. ion, and the selenide ion, Figure The common oxidation states that the nonmetals exhibit in their ionic and covalent compounds are shown in 18.19. Remember that an element exhibits a positive oxidation state when combined with a more electronegative element and that it exhibits a negative oxidation state when combined with a less electronegative element. Figure 18.19 Nonmetals exhibit these common oxidation states in ionic and covalent compounds. The first member of each nonmetal group exhibits different behaviors, in many respects, from the other group members. The reasons for this include smaller size, greater ionization energy, and (most important) the fact that the first member of each group has only four valence orbitals (one 2s and three 2p) available for bonding, whereas other group members have empty d orbitals in their valence shells, making possible five, six, or even more bonds around the central atom. For example, nitrogen forms only NF3, whereas phosphorus forms both PF3 and PF5. Another difference between the first group member and subsequent members is the greater ability of the first member to form π bonds. This is primarily a function of the smaller size of the first member of each group, which allows better overlap of atomic orbitals. Nonmetals, other than the first member of each group, rarely form π bonds to nonmetals that are the first member of a group. For example, sulfur-oxygen π bonds are well known, whereas sulfur does not normally form stable π bonds to itself.

1012 Chapter 18 | Representative Metals, Metalloids, and Nonmetals The variety of oxidation states displayed by most of the nonmetals means that many of their chemical reactions involve changes in oxidation state through oxidation-reduction reactions. There are four general aspects of the oxidation-reduction chemistry: Nonmetals oxidize most metals. The oxidation state of the metal becomes positive as it undergoes oxidation 1. and that of the nonmetal becomes negative as it undergoes reduction. For example: 4Fe(s) + 3O2(g) ⟶2Fe2 O3(s) 0 0 +3 −2 With the exception of nitrogen and carbon, which are poor oxidizing agents, a more electronegative nonmetal 2. oxidizes a less electronegative nonmetal or the anion of the nonmetal: S(s) + O2(g) ⟶2SO2(s) 0 −2 0 +4 2I−(aq) 2Cl−(aq) Cl2(g) + ⟶I2(s) + 0 0 Fluorine and oxygen are the strongest oxidizing agents within their respective groups; each oxidizes all the 3. elements that lie below it in the group. Within any period, the strongest oxidizing agent is in group 17. A nonmetal often oxidizes an element that lies to its left in the same period. For example: 2As(s) + 3Br2(l) ⟶2AsBr3(s) 0 0 +3 −1 The stronger a nonmetal is as an oxidizing agent, the more difficult it is to oxidize the anion formed by the 4. nonmetal. This means that the most stable negative ions are formed by elements at the top of the group or in group 17 of the period. Fluorine and oxygen are the strongest oxidizing elements known. Fluorine does not form compounds in which 5. it exhibits positive oxidation states; oxygen exhibits a positive oxidation state only when combined with fluorine. For example: 2OH−(aq) 2F−(aq) 2F2(g) + ⟶OF2(g) + + H2 O(l) 0 +2 −1 With the exception of most of the noble gases, all nonmetals form compounds with oxygen, yielding covalent oxides. Most of these oxides are acidic, that is, they react with water to form oxyacids. Recall from the acid-base chapter that an oxyacid is an acid consisting of hydrogen, oxygen, and some other element. Notable exceptions are carbon monoxide, CO, nitrous oxide, N2O, and nitric oxide, NO. There are three characteristics of these acidic oxides: Oxides such as SO2 and N2O5, in which the nonmetal exhibits one of its common oxidation states, are acid 1. anhydrides and react with water to form acids with no change in oxidation state. The product is an oxyacid. For example: SO2(g) + H2 O(l) ⟶H2 SO3(aq) N2 O5(s) + H2 O(l) ⟶2HNO3(aq) Those oxides such as NO2 and ClO2, in which the nonmetal does not exhibit one of its common oxidation 2. states, also react with water. In these reactions, the nonmetal is both oxidized and reduced. For example: ⟶2HNO3(aq) + NO(g) 3NO2(g) + H2 O(l) +4 +5 +2 Reactions in which the same element is both oxidized and reduced are called disproportionation reactions. The acid strength increases as the electronegativity of the central atom increases.

Chapter 18 | Representative Metals, Metalloids, and Nonmetals 1013 The binary hydrogen compounds of the nonmetals also exhibit an acidic behavior in water, although only HCl, HBr, and HI are strong acids. The acid strength of the nonmetal hydrogen compounds increases from left to right across a period and down a group. For example, ammonia, NH3, is a weaker acid than is water, H2O, which is weaker than is hydrogen fluoride, HF. Water, H2O, is also a weaker acid than is hydrogen sulfide, H2S, which is weaker than is hydrogen selenide, H2Se. Weaker acidic character implies greater basic character. Structures of the Nonmetals The structures of the nonmetals differ dramatically from those of metals. Metals crystallize in closely packed arrays that do not contain molecules or covalent bonds. Nonmetal structures contain covalent bonds, and many nonmetals consist of individual molecules. The electrons in nonmetals are localized in covalent bonds, whereas in a metal, there is delocalization of the electrons throughout the solid. The noble gases are all monatomic, whereas the other nonmetal gases—hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, fluorine, and chlorine—normally exist as the diatomic molecules H2, N2, O2, F2, and Cl2. The other halogens are also diatomic; Br2 is a liquid and I2 exists as a solid under normal conditions. The changes in state as one moves down the halogen family offer excellent examples of the increasing strength of intermolecular London forces with increasing molecular mass and increasing polarizability. Oxygen has two allotropes: O2, dioxygen, and O3, ozone. Phosphorus has three common allotropes, commonly referred to by their colors: white, red, and black. Sulfur has several allotropes. There are also many carbon allotropes. Most people know of diamond, graphite, and charcoal, but fewer people know of the recent discovery of fullerenes, carbon nanotubes, and graphene. Descriptions of the physical properties of three nonmetals that are characteristic of molecular solids follow. Carbon Carbon occurs in the uncombined (elemental) state in many forms, such as diamond, graphite, charcoal, coke, carbon black, graphene, and fullerene. Figure 18.20, Diamond, shown in is a very hard crystalline material that is colorless and transparent when pure. (sp3 Each atom forms four single bonds to four other atoms at the corners of a tetrahedron hybridization); this makes the diamond a giant molecule. Carbon-carbon single bonds are very strong, and, because they extend throughout the crystal to form a three-dimensional network, the crystals are very hard and have high melting points (~4400 °C). Figure 18.20 (a) Diamond and (b) graphite are two forms of carbon. (c) In the crystal structure of diamond, the covalent bonds form three-dimensional tetrahedrons. (d) In the crystal structure of graphite, each planar layer is composed of six-membered rings.

1014 Chapter 18 | Representative Metals, Metalloids, and Nonmetals Figure 18.20, Graphite, also shown in is a soft, slippery, grayish-black solid that conducts electricity. These properties relate to its structure, which consists of layers of carbon atoms, with each atom surrounded by three other carbon atoms in a trigonal planar arrangement. Each carbon atom in graphite forms three σ bonds, one to sp2-hybrid each of its nearest neighbors, by means of orbitals. The unhybridized p orbital on each carbon atom will overlap unhybridized orbitals on adjacent carbon atoms in the same layer to form π bonds. Many resonance forms are Figure 18.21 necessary to describe the electronic structure of a graphite layer; illustrates two of these forms. Figure 18.21 (a) Carbon atoms in graphite have unhybridized p orbitals. Each p orbital is perpendicular to the plane of carbon atoms. (b) These are two of the many resonance forms of graphite necessary to describe its electronic structure as a resonance hybrid. Atoms within a graphite layer are bonded together tightly by the σ and π bonds; however, the forces between layers are weak. London dispersion forces hold the layers together. To learn more, see the discussion of these weak forces in the chapter on liquids and solids. The weak forces between layers give graphite the soft, flaky character that makes it useful as the so-called “lead” in pencils and the slippery character that makes it useful as a lubricant. The loosely held electrons in the resonating π bonds can move throughout the solid and are responsible for the electrical conductivity of graphite. Other forms of elemental carbon include carbon black, charcoal, and coke. Carbon black is an amorphous form of carbon prepared by the incomplete combustion of natural gas, CH4. It is possible to produce charcoal and coke by heating wood and coal, respectively, at high temperatures in the absence of air. Recently, new forms of elemental carbon molecules have been identified in the soot generated by a smoky flame and in the vapor produced when graphite is heated to very high temperatures in a vacuum or in helium. One of these new forms, first isolated by Professor Richard Smalley and coworkers at Rice University, consists of icosahedral (soccer- ball-shaped) molecules that contain 60 carbon atoms, C60. This is buckminsterfullerene (often called bucky balls) (Figure after the architect Buckminster Fuller, who designed domed structures, which have a similar appearance 18.22). https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

Chemistry in Everyday Life Nanotubes and Graphene Graphene and carbon nanotubes are two recently discovered allotropes of carbon. Both of the forms bear some relationship to graphite. Graphene is a single layer of graphite (one atom thick), as illustrated in Figure 18.23, whereas carbon nanotubes roll the layer into a small tube, as illustrated in Figure 18.23. Figure 18.23 (a) Graphene and (b) carbon nanotubes are both allotropes of carbon. 

--- Page 1024 ---
1016 Chapter 18 | Representative Metals, Metalloids, and Nonmetals Graphene is a very strong, lightweight, and efficient conductor of heat and electricity discovered in 2003. As sp2-hybridized in graphite, the carbon atoms form a layer of six-membered rings with carbon atoms at the corners. Resonance stabilizes the system and leads to its conductivity. Unlike graphite, there is no stacking of the layers to give a three-dimensional structure. Andre Geim and Kostya Novoselov at the University of Manchester won the 2010 Nobel Prize in Physics for their pioneering work characterizing graphene. The simplest procedure for preparing graphene is to use a piece of adhesive tape to remove a single layer of graphene from the surface of a piece of graphite. This method works because there are only weak London dispersion forces between the layers in graphite. Alternative methods are to deposit a single layer of carbon atoms on the surface of some other material (ruthenium, iridium, or copper) or to synthesize it at the surface of silicon carbide via the sublimation of silicon. There currently are no commercial applications of graphene. However, its unusual properties, such as high electron mobility and thermal conductivity, should make it suitable for the manufacture of many advanced electronic devices and for thermal management applications. Carbon nanotubes are carbon allotropes, which have a cylindrical structure. Like graphite and graphene, sp2-hybridized nanotubes consist of rings of carbon atoms. Unlike graphite and graphene, which occur in layers, the layers wrap into a tube and bond together to produce a stable structure. The walls of the tube may be one atom or multiple atoms thick. Carbon nanotubes are extremely strong materials that are harder than diamond. Depending upon the shape of the nanotube, it may be a conductor or semiconductor. For some applications, the conducting form is preferable, whereas other applications utilize the semiconducting form. The basis for the synthesis of carbon nanotubes is the generation of carbon atoms in a vacuum. It is possible to produce carbon atoms by an electrical discharge through graphite, vaporization of graphite with a laser, and the decomposition of a carbon compound. The strength of carbon nanotubes will eventually lead to some of their most exciting applications, as a thread produced from several nanotubes will support enormous weight. However, the current applications only employ bulk nanotubes. The addition of nanotubes to polymers improves the mechanical, thermal, and electrical properties of the bulk material. There are currently nanotubes in some bicycle parts, skis, baseball bats, fishing rods, and surfboards. Phosphorus The name phosphorus comes from the Greek words meaning light bringing. When phosphorus was first isolated, scientists noted that it glowed in the dark and burned when exposed to air. Phosphorus is the only member of its group that does not occur in the uncombined state in nature; it exists in many allotropic forms. We will consider two of those forms: white phosphorus and red phosphorus. White phosphorus is a white, waxy solid that melts at 44.2 °C and boils at 280 °C. It is insoluble in water (in which it Figure 18.24), is stored—see is very soluble in carbon disulfide, and bursts into flame in air. As a solid, as a liquid, as a gas, and in solution, white phosphorus exists as P4 molecules with four phosphorus atoms at the corners of a Figure 18.24. regular tetrahedron, as illustrated in Each phosphorus atom covalently bonds to the other three atoms in the molecule by single covalent bonds. White phosphorus is the most reactive allotrope and is very toxic. https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

Chapter 18 | Representative Metals, Metalloids, and Nonmetals 1017 Figure 18.24 (a) Because white phosphorus bursts into flame in air, it is stored in water. (b) The structure of white phosphorus consists of P4 molecules arranged in a tetrahedron. (c) Red phosphorus is much less reactive than is white phosphorus. (d) The structure of red phosphorus consists of networks of P4 tetrahedra joined by P-P single bonds. (credit a: modification of work from http://images-of-elements.com/phosphorus.php) Heating white phosphorus to 270–300 °C in the absence of air yields red phosphorus. Red phosphorus (shown in Figure 18.24 Figure 18.24) and is denser, has a higher melting point (~600 °C), is much less reactive, is essentially nontoxic, and is easier and safer to handle than is white phosphorus. Its structure is highly polymeric and appears to contain three-dimensional networks of P4 tetrahedra joined by P-P single bonds. Red phosphorus is insoluble in solvents that dissolve white phosphorus. When red phosphorus is heated, P4 molecules sublime from the solid. Sulfur The allotropy of sulfur is far greater and more complex than that of any other element. Sulfur is the brimstone referred to in the Bible and other places, and references to sulfur occur throughout recorded history—right up to the relatively recent discovery that it is a component of the atmospheres of Venus and of Io, a moon of Jupiter. The most common and most stable allotrope of sulfur is yellow, rhombic sulfur, so named because of the shape or its crystals. Rhombic sulfur is the form to which all other allotropes revert at room temperature. Crystals of rhombic sulfur melt at 113 °C. Cooling this liquid gives long needles of monoclinic sulfur. This form is stable from 96 °C to the melting point, 119 °C. At room temperature, it gradually reverts to the rhombic form. Both rhombic sulfur and monoclinic sulfur contain S8 molecules in which atoms form eight-membered, puckered Figure 18.25. rings that resemble crowns, as illustrated in Each sulfur atom is bonded to each of its two neighbors in the ring by covalent S-S single bonds. 

--- Page 1026 ---
1018 Chapter 18 | Representative Metals, Metalloids, and Nonmetals Figure 18.25 These four sulfur allotropes show eight-membered, puckered rings. Each sulfur atom bonds to each of its two neighbors in the ring by covalent S-S single bonds. Here are (a) individual S8 rings, (b) S8 chains formed when the rings open, (c) longer chains formed by adding sulfur atoms to S8 chains, and (d) part of the very long sulfur chains formed at higher temperatures. When rhombic sulfur melts, the straw-colored liquid is quite mobile; its viscosity is low because S8 molecules are essentially spherical and offer relatively little resistance as they move past each other. As the temperature rises, S-S bonds in the rings break, and polymeric chains of sulfur atoms result. These chains combine end to end, forming still longer chains that tangle with one another. The liquid gradually darkens in color and becomes so viscous that finally (at about 230 °C) it does not pour easily. The dangling atoms at the ends of the chains of sulfur atoms are responsible for the dark red color because their electronic structure differs from those of sulfur atoms that have bonds to two adjacent sulfur atoms. This causes them to absorb light differently and results in a different visible color. Cooling the liquid rapidly produces a rubberlike amorphous mass, called plastic sulfur. Sulfur boils at 445 °C and forms a vapor consisting of S2, S6, and S8 molecules; at about 1000 °C, the vapor density corresponds to the formula S2, which is a paramagnetic molecule like O2 with a similar electronic structure and a weak sulfur-sulfur double bond. https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

Chapter 18 | Representative Metals, Metalloids, and Nonmetals 1019 As seen in this discussion, an important feature of the structural behavior of the nonmetals is that the elements usually occur with eight electrons in their valence shells. If necessary, the elements form enough covalent bonds to supplement the electrons already present to possess an octet. For example, members of group 15 have five valence elements and require only three additional electrons to fill their valence shells. These elements form three covalent bonds in their free state: triple bonds in the N2 molecule or single bonds to three different atoms in arsenic and phosphorus. The elements of group 16 require only two additional electrons. Oxygen forms a double bond in the O2 molecule, and sulfur, selenium, and tellurium form two single bonds in various rings and chains. The halogens form diatomic molecules in which each atom is involved in only one bond. This provides the electron required necessary to complete the octet on the halogen atom. The noble gases do not form covalent bonds to other noble gas atoms because they already have a filled outer shell. 18.5 Occurrence, Preparation, and Compounds of Hydrogen By the end of this section, you will be able to: Describe the properties, preparation, and compounds of hydrogen • Hydrogen is the most abundant element in the universe. The sun and other stars are composed largely of hydrogen. Astronomers estimate that 90% of the atoms in the universe are hydrogen atoms. Hydrogen is a component of more compounds than any other element. Water is the most abundant compound of hydrogen found on earth. Hydrogen is an important part of petroleum, many minerals, cellulose and starch, sugar, fats, oils, alcohols, acids, and thousands of other substances. At ordinary temperatures, hydrogen is a colorless, odorless, tasteless, and nonpoisonous gas consisting of the diatomic molecule H2. Hydrogen is composed of three isotopes, and unlike other elements, these isotopes have different names 1H, 2H 3H and chemical symbols: protium, deuterium, (or “D”), and tritium (or “T”). In a naturally occurring sample of hydrogen, there is one atom of deuterium for every 7000 H atoms and one atom of radioactive tritium for every 1018 H atoms. The chemical properties of the different isotopes are very similar because they have identical electron structures, but they differ in some physical properties because of their differing atomic masses. Elemental deuterium and tritium have lower vapor pressure than ordinary hydrogen. Consequently, when liquid hydrogen evaporates, the heavier isotopes are concentrated in the last portions to evaporate. Electrolysis of heavy water, D2O, yields deuterium. Most tritium originates from nuclear reactions. Preparation of Hydrogen Elemental hydrogen must be prepared from compounds by breaking chemical bonds. The most common methods of preparing hydrogen follow. From Steam and Carbon or Hydrocarbons Water is the cheapest and most abundant source of hydrogen. Passing steam over coke (an impure form of elemental carbon) at 1000 °C produces a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen known as water gas: 1000 °C C(s) + H2 O(g) ⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯ → CO(g) + H2(g) water gas Water gas is as an industrial fuel. It is possible to produce additional hydrogen by mixing the water gas with steam in the presence of a catalyst to convert the CO to CO2. This reaction is the water gas shift reaction. It is also possible to prepare a mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide by passing hydrocarbons from natural gas or petroleum and steam over a nickel-based catalyst. Propane is an example of a hydrocarbon reactant: 

--- Page 1028 ---
1020 Chapter 18 | Representative Metals, Metalloids, and Nonmetals 900 °C ⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯ → C3 H8(g) + 3H2 O(g) 3CO(g) + 7H2(g) catalyst Electrolysis Hydrogen forms when direct current electricity passes through water containing an electrolyte such as H2SO4, as Figure 18.26. illustrated in Bubbles of hydrogen form at the cathode, and oxygen evolves at the anode. The net reaction is: 2H2 O(l) + electrical energy ⟶2H2(g) + O2(g) Figure 18.26 The electrolysis of water produces hydrogen and oxygen. Because there are twice as many hydrogen atoms as oxygen atoms and both elements are diatomic, there is twice the volume of hydrogen produced at the cathode as there is oxygen produced at the anode. Reaction of Metals with Acids This is the most convenient laboratory method of producing hydrogen. Metals with lower reduction potentials reduce Figure 18.27, the hydrogen ion in dilute acids to produce hydrogen gas and metal salts. For example, as shown in iron in dilute hydrochloric acid produces hydrogen gas and iron(II) chloride: ⟶Fe2+(aq) O+(aq) 2Cl−(aq) 2Cl−(aq) Fe(s) + 2H3 + + + H2(g) + 2H2 O(l) https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

Chapter 18 | Representative Metals, Metalloids, and Nonmetals 1021 Figure 18.27 The reaction of iron with an acid produces hydrogen. Here, iron reacts with hydrochloric acid. (credit: Mark Ott) Reaction of Ionic Metal Hydrides with Water It is possible to produce hydrogen from the reaction of hydrides of the active metals, which contain the very strongly H−anion, basic with water: ⟶Ca2+(aq) 2OH−(aq) CaH2(s) + 2H2 O(l) + + 2H2(g) Metal hydrides are expensive but convenient sources of hydrogen, especially where space and weight are important factors. They are important in the inflation of life jackets, life rafts, and military balloons. Reactions Under normal conditions, hydrogen is relatively inactive chemically, but when heated, it enters into many chemical reactions. Two thirds of the world’s hydrogen production is devoted to the manufacture of ammonia, which is a fertilizer and used in the manufacture of nitric acid. Large quantities of hydrogen are also important in the process of hydrogenation, discussed in the chapter on organic chemistry. It is possible to use hydrogen as a nonpolluting fuel. The reaction of hydrogen with oxygen is a very exothermic reaction, releasing 286 kJ of energy per mole of water formed. Hydrogen burns without explosion under controlled conditions. The oxygen-hydrogen torch, because of the high heat of combustion of hydrogen, can achieve temperatures up to 2800 °C. The hot flame of this torch is useful in cutting thick sheets of many metals. Liquid (Figure 18.28). hydrogen is also an important rocket fuel

1022 Chapter 18 | Representative Metals, Metalloids, and Nonmetals Figure 18.28 Before the fleet’s retirement in 2011, liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen were used in the three main engines of a space shuttle. Two compartments in the large tank held these liquids until the shuttle was launched. (credit: “reynermedia”/Flickr) An uncombined hydrogen atom consists of a nucleus and one valence electron in the 1s orbital. The n = 1 valence shell has a capacity for two electrons, and hydrogen can rightfully occupy two locations in the periodic table. It is H+. possible to consider hydrogen a group 1 element because hydrogen can lose an electron to form the cation, It is also possible to consider hydrogen to be a group 17 element because it needs only one electron to fill its valence H−, orbital to form a hydride ion, or it can share an electron to form a single, covalent bond. In reality, hydrogen is a unique element that almost deserves its own location in the periodic table. Reactions with Elements When heated, hydrogen reacts with the metals of group 1 and with Ca, Sr, and Ba (the more active metals in group H−, 2). The compounds formed are crystalline, ionic hydrides that contain the hydride anion, a strong reducing agent and a strong base, which reacts vigorously with water and other acids to form hydrogen gas. The reactions of hydrogen with nonmetals generally produce acidic hydrogen compounds with hydrogen in the 1+ oxidation state. The reactions become more exothermic and vigorous as the electronegativity of the nonmetal increases. Hydrogen reacts with nitrogen and sulfur only when heated, but it reacts explosively with fluorine (forming HF) and, under some conditions, with chlorine (forming HCl). A mixture of hydrogen and oxygen explodes if ignited. Because of the explosive nature of the reaction, it is necessary to exercise caution when handling hydrogen (or any other combustible gas) to avoid the formation of an explosive mixture in a confined space. Although most hydrides of the nonmetals are acidic, ammonia and phosphine (PH3) are very, very weak acids and generally function as bases. Table 18.1.

Hydrogen may also reduce the metal ions in some metal oxides to lower oxidation states: ⎯⎯Δ H2(g) + MnO2(s) MnO(s) + H2 O(g) → Hydrogen Compounds Other than the noble gases, each of the nonmetals forms compounds with hydrogen. For brevity, we will discuss only a few hydrogen compounds of the nonmetals here. Nitrogen Hydrogen Compounds Ammonia, NH3, forms naturally when any nitrogen-containing organic material decomposes in the absence of air. The laboratory preparation of ammonia is by the reaction of an ammonium salt with a strong base such as sodium Figure 18.29. hydroxide. The acid-base reaction with the weakly acidic ammonium ion gives ammonia, illustrated in Ammonia also forms when ionic nitrides react with water. The nitride ion is a much stronger base than the hydroxide ion: 2NH3(g) Mg3 N2(s) + 6H2 O(l) ⟶3Mg(OH)2(s) + The commercial production of ammonia is by the direct combination of the elements in the Haber process: catalyst N2(g) + 3H2(g) ⇌ 2NH3(g) ΔH° = −92 kJ Figure 18.29 The structure of ammonia is shown with a central nitrogen atom and three hydrogen atoms. Ammonia is a colorless gas with a sharp, pungent odor. Smelling salts utilize this powerful odor. Gaseous ammonia readily liquefies to give a colorless liquid that boils at −33 °C. Due to intermolecular hydrogen bonding, the enthalpy of vaporization of liquid ammonia is higher than that of any other liquid except water, so ammonia is useful as a refrigerant. Ammonia is quite soluble in water (658 L at STP dissolves in 1 L H2O).

1024 Chapter 18 | Representative Metals, Metalloids, and Nonmetals The chemical properties of ammonia are as follows: Ammonia acts as a Brønsted base, as discussed in the chapter on acid-base chemistry. The ammonium ion is 1. similar in size to the potassium ion; compounds of the two ions exhibit many similarities in their structures and solubilities. Ammonia can display acidic behavior, although it is a much weaker acid than water. Like other acids, 2. ammonia reacts with metals, although it is so weak that high temperatures are necessary. Hydrogen and −), NH2−), N3−) NH2 (depending on the stoichiometry) amides (salts of imides (salts of or nitrides (salts of form. The nitrogen atom in ammonia has its lowest possible oxidation state (3−) and thus is not susceptible to 3. reduction. However, it can be oxidized. Ammonia burns in air, giving NO and water. Hot ammonia and the ammonium ion are active reducing agents. Of particular interest are the oxidations of ammonium ion by nitrite −, NO2 ion, to yield pure nitrogen and by nitrate ion to yield nitrous oxide, N2O. There are a number of compounds that we can consider derivatives of ammonia through the replacement 4. of one or more hydrogen atoms with some other atom or group of atoms. Inorganic derivations include chloramine, NH2Cl, and hydrazine, N2H4: Chloramine, NH2Cl, results from the reaction of sodium hypochlorite, NaOCl, with ammonia in basic solution. In the presence of a large excess of ammonia at low temperature, the chloramine reacts further to produce hydrazine, N2H4: OH−(aq) OCl−(aq) + NH3(aq) + ⟶NH2 Cl(aq) Cl−(aq) OH−(aq) + H2 O(l) NH2 Cl(aq) + NH3(aq) + ⟶N2 H4(aq) + Anhydrous hydrazine is relatively stable in spite of its positive free energy of formation: mol−1 N2(g) + 2H2(g) ⟶N2 H4(l) ΔGf° = 149.2 kJ Hydrazine is a fuming, colorless liquid that has some physical properties remarkably similar to those of H2O (it melts at 2 °C, boils at 113.5 °C, and has a density at 25 °C of 1.00 g/mL). It burns rapidly and completely in air with substantial evolution of heat: mol−1 N2 H4(l) + O2(g) ⟶N2(g) + 2H2 O(l) ΔH° = −621.5 kJ Like ammonia, hydrazine is both a Brønsted base and a Lewis base, although it is weaker than ammonia. It reacts with + 2+ N2 H5 N2 H6 strong acids and forms two series of salts that contain the and ions, respectively. Some rockets use hydrazine as a fuel. Phosphorus Hydrogen Compounds The most important hydride of phosphorus is phosphine, PH3, a gaseous analog of ammonia in terms of both formula and structure. Unlike ammonia, it is not possible to form phosphine by direct union of the elements. There are two methods for the preparation of phosphine. One method is by the action of an acid on an ionic phosphide. The other method is the disproportionation of white phosphorus with hot concentrated base to produce phosphine and the hydrogen phosphite ion: Al3+(aq) O+(aq) AlP(s) + 3H3 ⟶PH3(g) + + 3H2 O(l) https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

Chapter 18 | Representative Metals, Metalloids, and Nonmetals 1025 4OH−(aq) 2−(aq) P4(s) + + 2H2 O(l) ⟶2HPO3 + 2PH3(g) Phosphine is a colorless, very poisonous gas, which has an odor like that of decaying fish. Heat easily decomposes (4PH3 ⟶P4 + 6H2), phosphine and the compound burns in air. The major uses of phosphine are as a fumigant for grains and in semiconductor processing. Like ammonia, gaseous phosphine unites with gaseous hydrogen halides, forming phosphonium compounds like PH4Cl and PH4I. Phosphine is a much weaker base than ammonia; therefore, these compounds decompose in water, and the insoluble PH3 escapes from solution. Sulfur Hydrogen Compounds Hydrogen sulfide, H2S, is a colorless gas that is responsible for the offensive odor of rotten eggs and of many hot springs. Hydrogen sulfide is as toxic as hydrogen cyanide; therefore, it is necessary to exercise great care in handling it. Hydrogen sulfide is particularly deceptive because it paralyzes the olfactory nerves; after a short exposure, one does not smell it. The production of hydrogen sulfide by the direct reaction of the elements (H2 + S) is unsatisfactory because the yield is low. A more effective preparation method is the reaction of a metal sulfide with a dilute acid. For example: ⟶Fe2+(aq) O+(aq) FeS(s) + 2H3 + H2 S(g) + 2H2 O(l) It is easy to oxidize the sulfur in metal sulfides and in hydrogen sulfide, making metal sulfides and H2S good reducing −to 2−to Fe3+ Fe2+, Mn2+, Cr3+, MnO4 Cr2 O7 agents. In acidic solutions, hydrogen sulfide reduces to and HNO3 to NO2. The sulfur in H2S usually oxidizes to elemental sulfur, unless a large excess of the oxidizing agent is present. 2−or 2−(or SO3 SO4 to SO2 or SO3 in the absence of water): In which case, the sulfide may oxidize to 2H2 S(g) + O2(g) ⟶2S(s) + 2H2 O(l) This oxidation process leads to the removal of the hydrogen sulfide found in many sources of natural gas. The deposits of sulfur in volcanic regions may be the result of the oxidation of H2S present in volcanic gases. Hydrogen sulfide is a weak diprotic acid that dissolves in water to form hydrosulfuric acid. The acid ionizes in two HS−, S2−, stages, yielding hydrogen sulfide ions, in the first stage and sulfide ions, in the second. Since hydrogen sulfide is a weak acid, aqueous solutions of soluble sulfides and hydrogen sulfides are basic: ⇌HS−(aq) OH−(aq) S2−(aq) + + H2 O(l) OH−(aq) HS−(aq) ⇌H2 S(g) + + H2 O(l) Halogen Hydrogen Compounds Binary compounds containing only hydrogen and a halogen are hydrogen halides. At room temperature, the pure hydrogen halides HF, HCl, HBr, and HI are gases. In general, it is possible to prepare the halides by the general techniques used to prepare other acids. Fluorine, chlorine, and bromine react directly with hydrogen to form the respective hydrogen halide. This is a commercially important reaction for preparing hydrogen chloride and hydrogen bromide. The acid-base reaction between a nonvolatile strong acid and a metal halide will yield a hydrogen halide. The escape of the gaseous hydrogen halide drives the reaction to completion. For example, the usual method of preparing hydrogen fluoride is by heating a mixture of calcium fluoride, CaF2, and concentrated sulfuric acid: 2HF(g) CaF2(s) + H2 SO4(aq) ⟶CaSO4(s) + Gaseous hydrogen fluoride is also a by-product in the preparation of phosphate fertilizers by the reaction of fluoroapatite, Ca5(PO4)3F, with sulfuric acid. The reaction of concentrated sulfuric acid with a chloride salt produces hydrogen chloride both commercially and in the laboratory.

1026 Chapter 18 | Representative Metals, Metalloids, and Nonmetals In most cases, sodium chloride is the chloride of choice because it is the least expensive chloride. Hydrogen bromide and hydrogen iodide cannot be prepared using sulfuric acid because this acid is an oxidizing agent capable of oxidizing both bromide and iodide. However, it is possible to prepare both hydrogen bromide and hydrogen iodide using an acid such as phosphoric acid because it is a weaker oxidizing agent. For example: −(aq) Br−(aq) H3 PO4(l) ⟶HBr(g) + H2 PO4 + All of the hydrogen halides are very soluble in water, forming hydrohalic acids. With the exception of hydrogen fluoride, which has a strong hydrogen-fluoride bond, they are strong acids. Reactions of hydrohalic acids with metals, metal hydroxides, oxides, or carbonates produce salts of the halides. Most chloride salts are soluble in water. AgCl, PbCl2, and Hg2Cl2 are the commonly encountered exceptions. X−(aq). (Cl−, Br−, I−) The halide ions give the substances the properties associated with The heavier halide ions and can act as reducing agents, and the lighter halogens or other oxidizing agents will oxidize them: 2e−⟶2Cl−(aq) = 1.36 V Cl2(aq) + E° 2e−⟶2Br−(aq) = 1.09 V Br2(aq) + E° 2e−⟶2I−(aq) = 0.54 V I2(aq) + E° For example, bromine oxidizes iodine: I2(aq) E° = 0.55 V Br2(aq) + 2HI(aq) ⟶2HBr(aq) + Hydrofluoric acid is unique in its reactions with sand (silicon dioxide) and with glass, which is a mixture of silicates: SiO2(s) + 4HF(aq) ⟶SiF4(g) + 2H2 O(l) O(l) CaSiO3(s) + 6HF(aq) ⟶CaF2(s) + SiF4(g) + 3H2 The volatile silicon tetrafluoride escapes from these reactions. Because hydrogen fluoride attacks glass, it can frost or etch glass and is used to etch markings on thermometers, burets, and other glassware. The largest use for hydrogen fluoride is in production of hydrochlorofluorocarbons for refrigerants, in plastics, and in propellants. The second largest use is in the manufacture of cryolite, Na3AlF6, which is important in the production of aluminum. The acid is also important in the production of other inorganic fluorides (such as BF3), which serve as catalysts in the industrial synthesis of certain organic compounds. Hydrochloric acid is relatively inexpensive. It is an important and versatile acid in industry and is important for the manufacture of metal chlorides, dyes, glue, glucose, and various other chemicals. A considerable amount is also important for the activation of oil wells and as pickle liquor—an acid used to remove oxide coating from iron or steel that is to be galvanized, tinned, or enameled. The amounts of hydrobromic acid and hydroiodic acid used commercially are insignificant by comparison. 18.6 Occurrence, Preparation, and Properties of Carbonates By the end of this section, you will be able to: Describe the preparation, properties, and uses of some representative metal carbonates • The chemistry of carbon is extensive; however, most of this chemistry is not relevant to this chapter. The other aspects of the chemistry of carbon will appear in the chapter covering organic chemistry. In this chapter, we will focus on the carbonate ion and related substances.

Chapter 18 | Representative Metals, Metalloids, and Nonmetals 1027 calcium, strontium, and barium also form hydrogen carbonates—compounds that contain the hydrogen carbonate −, HCO3 also known as the bicarbonate anion. anion, With the exception of magnesium carbonate, it is possible to prepare carbonates of the metals of groups 1 and 2 by the reaction of carbon dioxide with the respective oxide or hydroxide. Examples of such reactions include: Na2 O(s) + CO2(g) ⟶Na2 CO3(s) Ca(OH)2(s) + CO2(g) ⟶CaCO3(s) + H2 O(l) The carbonates of the alkaline earth metals of group 12 and lead(II) are not soluble. These carbonates precipitate upon mixing a solution of soluble alkali metal carbonate with a solution of soluble salts of these metals. Examples of net ionic equations for the reactions are: Ca2+(aq) 2−(aq) + CO3 ⟶CaCO3(s) Pb2+(aq) 2−(aq) + CO3 ⟶PbCO3(s) Pearls and the shells of most mollusks are calcium carbonate. Tin(II) or one of the trivalent or tetravalent ions such Al3+ Sn4+ as or behave differently in this reaction as carbon dioxide and the corresponding oxide form instead of the carbonate. Alkali metal hydrogen carbonates such as NaHCO3 and CsHCO3 form by saturating a solution of the hydroxides with carbon dioxide. The net ionic reaction involves hydroxide ion and carbon dioxide: OH−(aq) −(aq) + CO2(aq) ⟶HCO3 It is possible to isolate the solids by evaporation of the water from the solution. Although they are insoluble in pure water, alkaline earth carbonates dissolve readily in water containing carbon dioxide because hydrogen carbonate salts form. For example, caves and sinkholes form in limestone when CaCO3 dissolves in water containing dissolved carbon dioxide: ⟶Ca2+(aq) −(aq) + 2HCO3 CaCO3(s) + CO2(aq) + H2 O(l) Hydrogen carbonates of the alkaline earth metals remain stable only in solution; evaporation of the solution produces Figure 18.30, the carbonate. Stalactites and stalagmites, like those shown in form in caves when drops of water containing dissolved calcium hydrogen carbonate evaporate to leave a deposit of calcium carbonate. Figure 18.30 (a) Stalactites and (b) stalagmites are cave formations of calcium carbonate.

1028 Chapter 18 | Representative Metals, Metalloids, and Nonmetals The two carbonates used commercially in the largest quantities are sodium carbonate and calcium carbonate. In the United States, sodium carbonate is extracted from the mineral trona, Na3(CO3)(HCO3)(H2O)2. Following recrystallization to remove clay and other impurities, heating the recrystallized trona produces Na2CO3: 2Na3(CO3)(HCO3)(H2 O)2(s) ⟶3Na2 CO3(s) + 5H2 O(l) + CO2(g) Carbonates are moderately strong bases. Aqueous solutions are basic because the carbonate ion accepts hydrogen ion from water in this reversible reaction: 2−(aq) −(aq) OH−(aq) CO3 + H2 O(l) ⇌HCO3 + Carbonates react with acids to form salts of the metal, gaseous carbon dioxide, and water. The reaction of calcium Figure carbonate, the active ingredient of the antacid Tums, with hydrochloric acid (stomach acid), as shown in 18.31, illustrates the reaction: CO2(g) + H2 O(l) CaCO3(s) + 2HCl(aq) ⟶CaCl2(aq) + Figure 18.31 The reaction of calcium carbonate with hydrochloric acid is shown. (credit: Mark Ott) Other applications of carbonates include glass making—where carbonate ions serve as a source of oxide ions—and synthesis of oxides. Hydrogen carbonates are amphoteric because they act as both weak acids and weak bases. Hydrogen carbonate ions act as acids and react with solutions of soluble hydroxides to form a carbonate and water: + H2 O(l) KHCO3(aq) + KOH(aq) ⟶K2 CO3(aq) With acids, hydrogen carbonates form a salt, carbon dioxide, and water. Baking soda (bicarbonate of soda or sodium bicarbonate) is sodium hydrogen carbonate. Baking powder contains baking soda and a solid acid such as potassium hydrogen tartrate (cream of tartar), KHC4H4O6. As long as the powder is dry, no reaction occurs; immediately after the addition of water, the acid reacts with the hydrogen carbonate ions to form carbon dioxide: −(aq) 2−(aq) −(aq) + HCO3 ⟶C4 H4 O6 + CO2(g) + H2 O(l) HC4 H4 O6 Dough will trap the carbon dioxide, causing it to expand during baking, producing the characteristic texture of baked goods. https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

Chapter 18 | Representative Metals, Metalloids, and Nonmetals 1029 18.7 Occurrence, Preparation, and Properties of Nitrogen By the end of this section, you will be able to: Describe the properties, preparation, and uses of nitrogen • Most pure nitrogen comes from the fractional distillation of liquid air. The atmosphere consists of 78% nitrogen by volume. This means there are more than 20 million tons of nitrogen over every square mile of the earth’s surface. Nitrogen is a component of proteins and of the genetic material (DNA/RNA) of all plants and animals. Under ordinary conditions, nitrogen is a colorless, odorless, and tasteless gas. It boils at 77 K and freezes at 63 K. Liquid nitrogen is a useful coolant because it is inexpensive and has a low boiling point. Nitrogen is very unreactive because of the very strong triple bond between the nitrogen atoms. The only common reactions at room temperature occur with lithium to form Li3N, with certain transition metal complexes, and with hydrogen or oxygen in nitrogen- fixing bacteria. The general lack of reactivity of nitrogen makes the remarkable ability of some bacteria to synthesize nitrogen compounds using atmospheric nitrogen gas as the source one of the most exciting chemical events on our planet. This process is one type of nitrogen fixation. In this case, nitrogen fixation is the process where organisms convert atmospheric nitrogen into biologically useful chemicals. Nitrogen fixation also occurs when lightning passes through air, causing molecular nitrogen to react with oxygen to form nitrogen oxides, which are then carried down to the soil. Chemistry in Everyday Life Nitrogen Fixation All living organisms require nitrogen compounds for survival. Unfortunately, most of these organisms cannot absorb nitrogen from its most abundant source—the atmosphere. Atmospheric nitrogen consists of N2 molecules, which are very unreactive due to the strong nitrogen-nitrogen triple bond. However, a few organisms can overcome this problem through a process known as nitrogen fixation, illustrated in Figure 18.32. 

--- Page 1038 ---
1030 Chapter 18 | Representative Metals, Metalloids, and Nonmetals Figure 18.32 All living organisms require nitrogen. A few microorganisms are able to process atmospheric nitrogen using nitrogen fixation. (credit “roots”: modification of work by the United States Department of Agriculture; credit “root nodules”: modification of work by Louisa Howard) Nitrogen fixation is the process where organisms convert atmospheric nitrogen into biologically useful chemicals. To date, the only known kind of biological organisms capable of nitrogen fixation are microorganisms. These organisms employ enzymes called nitrogenases, which contain iron and molybdenum. Many of these microorganisms live in a symbiotic relationship with plants, with the best-known example being the presence of rhizobia in the root nodules of legumes. Large volumes of atmospheric nitrogen are necessary for making ammonia—the principal starting material used for preparation of large quantities of other nitrogen-containing compounds. Most other uses for elemental nitrogen depend on its inactivity. It is helpful when a chemical process requires an inert atmosphere. Canned foods and luncheon meats cannot oxidize in a pure nitrogen atmosphere, so they retain a better flavor and color, and spoil less rapidly, when sealed in nitrogen instead of air. This technology allows fresh produce to be available year-round, regardless of growing season. https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

Chapter 18 | Representative Metals, Metalloids, and Nonmetals 1031 There are compounds with nitrogen in all of its oxidation states from 3−to 5+. Much of the chemistry of nitrogen involves oxidation-reduction reactions. Some active metals (such as alkali metals and alkaline earth metals) can reduce nitrogen to form metal nitrides. In the remainder of this section, we will examine nitrogen-oxygen chemistry. There are well-characterized nitrogen oxides in which nitrogen exhibits each of its positive oxidation numbers from 1+ to 5+. When ammonium nitrate is carefully heated, nitrous oxide (dinitrogen oxide) and water vapor form. Stronger heating generates nitrogen gas, oxygen gas, and water vapor. No one should ever attempt this reaction—it can be very explosive. In 1947, there was a major ammonium nitrate explosion in Texas City, Texas, and, in 2013, there was another major explosion in West, Texas. In the last 100 years, there were nearly 30 similar disasters worldwide, resulting in the loss of numerous lives. In this oxidation-reduction reaction, the nitrogen in the nitrate ion Figure 18.33, oxidizes the nitrogen in the ammonium ion. Nitrous oxide, shown in is a colorless gas possessing a mild, pleasing odor and a sweet taste. It finds application as an anesthetic for minor operations, especially in dentistry, under the name “laughing gas.” Figure 18.33 Nitrous oxide, N2O, is an anesthetic that has these molecular (left) and resonance (right) structures. Low yields of nitric oxide, NO, form when heating nitrogen and oxygen together. NO also forms when lightning passes through air during thunderstorms. Burning ammonia is the commercial method of preparing nitric oxide. In the laboratory, the reduction of nitric acid is the best method for preparing nitric oxide. When copper reacts with dilute nitric acid, nitric oxide is the principal reduction product: 3Cu(s) + 8HNO3(aq) ⟶2NO(g) + 3Cu(NO3)2(aq) + 4H2 O(l) Gaseous nitric oxide is the most thermally stable of the nitrogen oxides and is the simplest known thermally stable molecule with an unpaired electron. It is one of the air pollutants generated by internal combustion engines, resulting from the reaction of atmospheric nitrogen and oxygen during the combustion process. At room temperature, nitric oxide is a colorless gas consisting of diatomic molecules. As is often the case with molecules that contain an unpaired electron, two molecules combine to form a dimer by pairing their unpaired Figure 18.34. electrons to form a bond. Liquid and solid NO both contain N2O2 dimers, like that shown in Most substances with unpaired electrons exhibit color by absorbing visible light; however, NO is colorless because the absorption of light is not in the visible region of the spectrum. Figure 18.34 This shows the equilibrium between NO and N2O2. The molecule, N2O2, absorbs light. Cooling a mixture of equal parts nitric oxide and nitrogen dioxide to −21 °C produces dinitrogen trioxide, a blue Figure 18.35). liquid consisting of N2O3 molecules (shown in Dinitrogen trioxide exists only in the liquid and solid states. When heated, it reverts to a mixture of NO and NO2.

It is possible to prepare nitrogen dioxide in the laboratory by heating the nitrate of a heavy metal, or by the reduction Figure 18.36. of concentrated nitric acid with copper metal, as shown in Commercially, it is possible to prepare nitrogen dioxide by oxidizing nitric oxide with air. Figure 18.36 The reaction of copper metal with concentrated HNO3 produces a solution of Cu(NO3)2 and brown fumes of NO2.

It is also responsible for the dimerization of NO2. At low pressures or at high temperatures, nitrogen dioxide has a deep brown color that is due to the presence of the NO2 molecule. At low temperatures, the color almost entirely disappears as dinitrogen tetraoxide, N2O4, forms. At room temperature, an equilibrium exists: 2NO2(g) ⇌N2 O4(g) KP = 6.86 https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

Chapter 18 | Representative Metals, Metalloids, and Nonmetals 1033 Figure 18.37 The molecular and resonance structures for nitrogen dioxide (NO2, left) and dinitrogen tetraoxide (N2O4, right) are shown. Figure 18.38), Dinitrogen pentaoxide, N2O5 (illustrated in is a white solid that is formed by the dehydration of nitric acid by phosphorus(V) oxide (tetraphosphorus decoxide): P4 O10(s) + 4HNO3(l) ⟶4HPO3(s) + 2N2 O5(s) It is unstable above room temperature, decomposing to N2O4 and O2. Figure 18.38 This image shows the molecular structure and one resonance structure of a molecule of dinitrogen pentaoxide, N2O5. The oxides of nitrogen(III), nitrogen(IV), and nitrogen(V) react with water and form nitrogen-containing oxyacids. Nitrogen(III) oxide, N2O3, is the anhydride of nitrous acid; HNO2 forms when N2O3 reacts with water. There are no stable oxyacids containing nitrogen with an oxidation state of 4+; therefore, nitrogen(IV) oxide, NO2, disproportionates in one of two ways when it reacts with water. In cold water, a mixture of HNO2 and HNO3 forms. At higher temperatures, HNO3 and NO will form. Nitrogen(V) oxide, N2O5, is the anhydride of nitric acid; HNO3 is produced when N2O5 reacts with water: N2 O5(s) + H2 O(l) ⟶2HNO3(aq) The nitrogen oxides exhibit extensive oxidation-reduction behavior. Nitrous oxide resembles oxygen in its behavior when heated with combustible substances. N2O is a strong oxidizing agent that decomposes when heated to form nitrogen and oxygen. Because one-third of the gas liberated is oxygen, nitrous oxide supports combustion better than air (one-fifth oxygen). A glowing splinter bursts into flame when thrust into a bottle of this gas. Nitric oxide acts both as an oxidizing agent and as a reducing agent. For example:

For example: NO2(g) + CO(g) ⟶NO(g) + CO2(g) NO2(g) + 2HCl(aq) ⟶NO(g) Cl2(g) + H2 O(l) + 18.8 Occurrence, Preparation, and Properties of Phosphorus By the end of this section, you will be able to: Describe the properties, preparation, and uses of phosphorus • The industrial preparation of phosphorus is by heating calcium phosphate, obtained from phosphate rock, with sand and coke: ⎯⎯Δ 2Ca3 (PO4)2(s) + 6SiO2(s) + 10C(s) 6CaSiO3(l) + 10CO(g) + P4(g) → The phosphorus distills out of the furnace and is condensed into a solid or burned to form P4O10. The preparation of many other phosphorus compounds begins with P4O10. The acids and phosphates are useful as fertilizers and in the chemical industry. Other uses are in the manufacture of special alloys such as ferrophosphorus and phosphor bronze. Phosphorus is important in making pesticides, matches, and some plastics. Phosphorus is an active nonmetal. In compounds, phosphorus usually occurs in oxidation states of 3−, 3+, and 5+. Phosphorus exhibits oxidation numbers that are unusual for a group 15 element in compounds that contain phosphorus-phosphorus bonds; examples include Figure 18.39. diphosphorus tetrahydride, H2P-PH2, and tetraphosphorus trisulfide, P4S3, illustrated in Figure 18.39 P4S3 is a component of the heads of strike-anywhere matches.

Figure 18.40 This image shows the molecular structures of P4O6 (left) and P4O10 (right). Phosphorus(V) oxide, P4O10, is a white powder that is prepared by burning phosphorus in excess oxygen. Its enthalpy of formation is very high (−2984 kJ), and it is quite stable and a very poor oxidizing agent. Dropping P4O10 into water produces a hissing sound, heat, and orthophosphoric acid: P4 O10(s) + 6H2 O(l) ⟶4H3 PO4(aq) Because of its great affinity for water, phosphorus(V) oxide is an excellent drying agent for gases and solvents, and for removing water from many compounds. Phosphorus Halogen Compounds Phosphorus will react directly with the halogens, forming trihalides, PX3, and pentahalides, PX5. The trihalides are much more stable than the corresponding nitrogen trihalides; nitrogen pentahalides do not form because of nitrogen’s inability to form more than four bonds. Figure 18.41, The chlorides PCl3 and PCl5, both shown in are the most important halides of phosphorus. Phosphorus trichloride is a colorless liquid that is prepared by passing chlorine over molten phosphorus. Phosphorus pentachloride is an off-white solid that is prepared by oxidizing the trichloride with excess chlorine. The pentachloride sublimes when warmed and forms an equilibrium with the trichloride and chlorine when heated. Figure 18.41 This image shows the molecular structure of PCl3 (left) and PCl5 (right) in the gas phase.

The earth’s surface is composed of the crust, atmosphere, and hydrosphere. About 50% of the mass of the earth’s crust consists of oxygen (combined with other elements, principally silicon). Oxygen occurs as O2 molecules and, to a limited extent, as O3 (ozone) molecules in air. It forms about 20% of the mass of the air. About 89% of water by mass consists of combined oxygen. In combination with carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen, oxygen is a large part of plants and animals. Oxygen is a colorless, odorless, and tasteless gas at ordinary temperatures. It is slightly denser than air. Although it is only slightly soluble in water (49 mL of gas dissolves in 1 L at STP), oxygen’s solubility is very important to aquatic life. Most of the oxygen isolated commercially comes from air and the remainder from the electrolysis of water. The separation of oxygen from air begins with cooling and compressing the air until it liquefies. As liquid air warms, oxygen with its higher boiling point (90 K) separates from nitrogen, which has a lower boiling point (77 K). It is possible to separate the other components of air at the same time based on differences in their boiling points. Oxygen is essential in combustion processes such as the burning of fuels. Plants and animals use the oxygen from the air in respiration. The administration of oxygen-enriched air is an important medical practice when a patient is receiving an inadequate supply of oxygen because of shock, pneumonia, or some other illness. The chemical industry employs oxygen for oxidizing many substances. A significant amount of oxygen produced commercially is important in the removal of carbon from iron during steel production. Large quantities of pure oxygen are also necessary in metal fabrication and in the cutting and welding of metals with oxyhydrogen and oxyacetylene torches. Liquid oxygen is important to the space industry. It is an oxidizing agent in rocket engines. It is also the source of gaseous oxygen for life support in space. As we know, oxygen is very important to life. The energy required for the maintenance of normal body functions in human beings and in other organisms comes from the slow oxidation of chemical compounds. Oxygen is the final oxidizing agent in these reactions. In humans, oxygen passes from the lungs into the blood, where it combines with hemoglobin, producing oxyhemoglobin. In this form, blood transports the oxygen to tissues, where it is transferred to the tissues. The ultimate products are carbon dioxide and water. The blood carries the carbon dioxide through the veins to the lungs, where the blood releases the carbon dioxide and collects another supply of oxygen. Digestion and assimilation of food regenerate the materials consumed by oxidation in the body; the energy liberated is the same as if the food burned outside the body. https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

Chapter 18 | Representative Metals, Metalloids, and Nonmetals 1037 Green plants continually replenish the oxygen in the atmosphere by a process called photosynthesis. The products of photosynthesis may vary, but, in general, the process converts carbon dioxide and water into glucose (a sugar) and oxygen using the energy of light: chlorophyll ⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯ → O(l) C6 H12 O6(aq) + 6O2(g) 6CO2(g) + 6H2 light carbon water glucose oxygen dioxide Thus, the oxygen that became carbon dioxide and water by the metabolic processes in plants and animals returns to the atmosphere by photosynthesis. Figure 18.42), When dry oxygen is passed between two electrically charged plates, ozone (O3, illustrated in an allotrope of oxygen possessing a distinctive odor, forms. The formation of ozone from oxygen is an endothermic reaction, in which the energy comes from an electrical discharge, heat, or ultraviolet light: electric discharge ⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯ → 3O2(g) 2O3(g) ΔH° = 287 kJ The sharp odor associated with sparking electrical equipment is due, in part, to ozone. Figure 18.42 The image shows the bent ozone (O3) molecule and the resonance structures necessary to describe its bonding. Ozone forms naturally in the upper atmosphere by the action of ultraviolet light from the sun on the oxygen there. Most atmospheric ozone occurs in the stratosphere, a layer of the atmosphere extending from about 10 to 50 kilometers above the earth’s surface. This ozone acts as a barrier to harmful ultraviolet light from the sun by absorbing it via a chemical decomposition reaction: ultraviolet light ⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯ → O(g) + O2(g) O3(g) The reactive oxygen atoms recombine with molecular oxygen to complete the ozone cycle. The presence of stratospheric ozone decreases the frequency of skin cancer and other damaging effects of ultraviolet radiation. It has been clearly demonstrated that chlorofluorocarbons, CFCs (known commercially as Freons), which were present as aerosol propellants in spray cans and as refrigerants, caused depletion of ozone in the stratosphere. This occurred because ultraviolet light also causes CFCs to decompose, producing atomic chlorine. The chlorine atoms react with ozone molecules, resulting in a net removal of O3 molecules from stratosphere. This process is explored in detail in our coverage of chemical kinetics. There is a worldwide effort to reduce the amount of CFCs used commercially, and the ozone hole is already beginning to decrease in size as atmospheric concentrations of atomic chlorine decrease. While ozone in the stratosphere helps protect us, ozone in the troposphere is a problem. This ozone is a toxic component of photochemical smog. The uses of ozone depend on its reactivity with other substances. It can be used as a bleaching agent for oils, waxes, fabrics, and starch: It oxidizes the colored compounds in these substances to colorless compounds. It is an alternative to chlorine as a disinfectant for water.

1038 Chapter 18 | Representative Metals, Metalloids, and Nonmetals Reactions Elemental oxygen is a strong oxidizing agent. It reacts with most other elements and many compounds. Reaction with Elements Oxygen reacts directly at room temperature or at elevated temperatures with all other elements except the noble gases, the halogens, and few second- and third-row transition metals of low reactivity (those with higher reduction potentials than copper). Rust is an example of the reaction of oxygen with iron. The more active metals form peroxides or superoxides. Less active metals and the nonmetals give oxides. Two examples of these reactions are: O2(g) ⟶2MgO(s) 2Mg(s) + 5O2(g) ⟶P4 O10(s) P4(s) + The oxides of halogens, at least one of the noble gases, and metals with higher reduction potentials than copper do not form by the direct action of the elements with oxygen. Reaction with Compounds Elemental oxygen also reacts with some compounds. If it is possible to oxidize any of the elements in a given compound, further oxidation by oxygen can occur. For example, hydrogen sulfide, H2S, contains sulfur with an oxidation state of 2−. Because the sulfur does not exhibit its maximum oxidation state, we would expect H2S to react with oxygen. It does, yielding water and sulfur dioxide. The reaction is: 3O2(g) ⟶2H2 O(l) + 2SO2(g) 2H2 S(g) + It is also possible to oxidize oxides such as CO and P4O6 that contain an element with a lower oxidation state. The ease with which elemental oxygen picks up electrons is mirrored by the difficulty of removing electrons from oxygen in most oxides. Of the elements, only the very reactive fluorine can oxidize oxides to form oxygen gas. Oxides, Peroxides, and Hydroxides Compounds of the representative metals with oxygen fall into three categories: (1) oxides, containing oxide ions, 2−, O2−; O2 with oxygen-oxygen covalent single bonds and a very limited (2) peroxides, containing peroxides ions, −, O2 number of superoxides, containing superoxide ions, with oxygen-oxygen covalent bonds that have a bond 1 OH−. 1 2, order of In addition, there are (3) hydroxides, containing hydroxide ions, All representative metals form oxides. Some of the metals of group 2 also form peroxides, MO2, and the metals of group 1 also form peroxides, M2O2, and superoxides, MO2. Oxides It is possible to produce the oxides of most representative metals by heating the corresponding hydroxides (forming the oxide and gaseous water) or carbonates (forming the oxide and gaseous CO2). Equations for example reactions are: ⎯⎯Δ 2Al(OH)3(s) Al2 O3(s) + 3H2 O(g) → ⎯⎯Δ CaCO3(s) CaO(s) + CO2(g) → However, alkali metal salts generally are very stable and do not decompose easily when heated. Alkali metal oxides result from the oxidation-reduction reactions created by heating nitrates or hydroxides with the metals.

Chapter 18 | Representative Metals, Metalloids, and Nonmetals 1039 ⎯⎯Δ 2KNO3(s) + 10K(s) 6K2 O(s) + N2(g) → ⎯⎯Δ 2Li2 O(s) + H2(g) 2LiOH(s) + 2Li(s) → With the exception of mercury(II) oxide, it is possible to produce the oxides of the metals of groups 2–15 by burning the corresponding metal in air. The heaviest member of each group, the member for which the inert pair effect is most pronounced, forms an oxide in which the oxidation state of the metal ion is two less than the group oxidation state (inert pair effect). Thus, Tl2O, PbO, and Bi2O3 form when burning thallium, lead, and bismuth, respectively. The oxides of the lighter members of each group exhibit the group oxidation state. For example, SnO2 forms from burning tin. Mercury(II) oxide, HgO, forms slowly when mercury is warmed below 500 °C; it decomposes at higher temperatures. Burning the members of groups 1 and 2 in air is not a suitable way to form the oxides of these elements. These metals are reactive enough to combine with nitrogen in the air, so they form mixtures of oxides and ionic nitrides. Several also form peroxides or superoxides when heated in air. Ionic oxides all contain the oxide ion, a very powerful hydrogen ion acceptor. With the exception of the very insoluble aluminum oxide, Al2O3, tin(IV), SnO2, and lead(IV), PbO2, the oxides of the representative metals react with acids to form salts. Some equations for these reactions are: O(l) Na2 O + 2HNO3(aq) ⟶2NaNO3(aq) + H2 + H2 O(l) CaO(s) + 2HCL(aq) ⟶CaCl2(aq) + H2 O(l) SnO(s) + 2HClO4(aq) ⟶Sn(ClO4)2(aq) The oxides of the metals of groups 1 and 2 and of thallium(I) oxide react with water and form hydroxides. Examples of such reactions are: Na2 O(s) + H2 O(l) ⟶NaOH(aq) CaO(s) + H2 O(l) ⟶Ca(OH)2(aq) Tl2 O(s) + H2 O(aq) ⟶2TlOH(aq) The oxides of the alkali metals have little industrial utility, unlike magnesium oxide, calcium oxide, and aluminum oxide. Magnesium oxide is important in making firebrick, crucibles, furnace linings, and thermal insulation—applications that require chemical and thermal stability. Calcium oxide, sometimes called quicklime or lime in the industrial market, is very reactive, and its principal uses reflect its reactivity. Pure calcium oxide emits Figure 18.43). an intense white light when heated to a high temperature (as illustrated in Blocks of calcium oxide heated by gas flames were the stage lights in theaters before electricity was available. This is the source of the phrase “in the limelight.” Figure 18.43 Calcium oxide has many industrial uses. When it is heated at high temperatures, it emits an intense white light.

1040 Chapter 18 | Representative Metals, Metalloids, and Nonmetals Calcium oxide and calcium hydroxide are inexpensive bases used extensively in chemical processing, although most of the useful products prepared from them do not contain calcium. Calcium oxide, CaO, is made by heating calcium carbonate, CaCO3, which is widely and inexpensively available as limestone or oyster shells: CaCO3(s) ⟶CaO(s) + CO2(g) Although this decomposition reaction is reversible, it is possible to obtain a 100% yield of CaO by allowing the CO2 to escape. It is possible to prepare calcium hydroxide by the familiar acid-base reaction of a soluble metal oxide with water: CaO(s) + H2 O(l) ⟶Ca(OH)2(s) Both CaO and Ca(OH)2 are useful as bases; they accept protons and neutralize acids. Alumina (Al2O3) occurs in nature as the mineral corundum, a very hard substance used as an abrasive for grinding and polishing. Corundum is important to the jewelry trade as ruby and sapphire. The color of ruby is due to the presence of a small amount of chromium; other impurities produce the wide variety of colors possible for sapphires. Artificial rubies and sapphires are now manufactured by melting aluminum oxide (melting point = 2050 °C) with small amounts of oxides to produce the desired colors and cooling the melt in such a way as to produce large crystals. Ruby lasers use synthetic ruby crystals. Zinc oxide, ZnO, was a useful white paint pigment; however, pollutants tend to discolor the compound. The compound is also important in the manufacture of automobile tires and other rubber goods, and in the preparation of Figure 18.44, medicinal ointments. For example, zinc-oxide-based sunscreens, as shown in help prevent sunburn. The zinc oxide in these sunscreens is present in the form of very small grains known as nanoparticles. Lead dioxide is a constituent of charged lead storage batteries. Lead(IV) tends to revert to the more stable lead(II) ion by gaining two electrons, so lead dioxide is a powerful oxidizing agent. Figure 18.44 Zinc oxide protects exposed skin from sunburn. (credit: modification of work by "osseous"/Flickr) Peroxides and Superoxides Peroxides and superoxides are strong oxidizers and are important in chemical processes. Hydrogen peroxide, H2O2, prepared from metal peroxides, is an important bleach and disinfectant. Peroxides and superoxides form when the metal or metal oxides of groups 1 and 2 react with pure oxygen at elevated temperatures. Sodium peroxide and the peroxides of calcium, strontium, and barium form by heating the corresponding metal or metal oxide in pure oxygen: ⎯⎯Δ 2Na(s) + O2(g) Na2 O2(s) → ⎯⎯Δ 2Na2 O(s) + O2(g) 2Na2 O2(s) → ⎯⎯Δ O2(g) 2SrO(s) + 2SrO2(s) → https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

Chapter 18 | Representative Metals, Metalloids, and Nonmetals 1041 The peroxides of potassium, rubidium, and cesium can be prepared by heating the metal or its oxide in a carefully controlled amount of oxygen: 2K(s) + O2(g) (2 mol K per mol O2) ⟶K2 O2(s) With an excess of oxygen, the superoxides KO2, RbO2, and CsO2 form. For example: mol K per mol O2) K(s) + O2(g) ⟶KO2(s) (1 The stability of the peroxides and superoxides of the alkali metals increases as the size of the cation increases. Hydroxides OH−ion. Hydroxides are compounds that contain the It is possible to prepare these compounds by two general types of reactions. Soluble metal hydroxides can be produced by the reaction of the metal or metal oxide with water. Insoluble metal hydroxides form when a solution of a soluble salt of the metal combines with a solution containing hydroxide ions. With the exception of beryllium and magnesium, the metals of groups 1 and 2 react with water to form hydroxides and hydrogen gas. Examples of such reactions include: ⟶2LiOH(aq) + H2(g) 2Li(s) + 2H2 O(l) ⟶Ca(OH)2(aq) + H2(g) Ca(s) + 2H2 O(l) However, these reactions can be violent and dangerous; therefore, it is preferable to produce soluble metal hydroxides by the reaction of the respective oxide with water: Li2 O(s) + H2 O(l) ⟶2LiOH(aq) CaO(s) + H2 O(l) ⟶Ca(OH)2(aq) Most metal oxides are base anhydrides. This is obvious for the soluble oxides because they form metal hydroxides. Most other metal oxides are insoluble and do not form hydroxides in water; however, they are still base anhydrides because they will react with acids. It is possible to prepare the insoluble hydroxides of beryllium, magnesium, and other representative metals by the addition of sodium hydroxide to a solution of a salt of the respective metal. The net ionic equations for the reactions involving a magnesium salt, an aluminum salt, and a zinc salt are: Mg2+(aq) 2OH−(aq) + ⟶Mg(OH)2(s) Al3+(aq) 3OH−(aq) + ⟶Al(OH)3(s) Zn2+(aq) 2OH−(aq) + ⟶Zn(OH)2(s) An excess of hydroxide must be avoided when preparing aluminum, gallium, zinc, and tin(II) hydroxides, or −, −, Al(OH)4 Ga(OH)4 the hydroxides will dissolve with the formation of the corresponding complex ions: 2−, −(see Zn(OH)4 Sn(OH)3 Figure 18.45). and The important aspect of complex ions for this chapter is that they form by a Lewis acid-base reaction with the metal being the Lewis acid.

(b) Addition of an excess of NaOH results in dissolution of the precipitate. (credit: modification of work by Mark Ott) Industry uses large quantities of sodium hydroxide as a cheap, strong base. Sodium chloride is the starting material for the production of NaOH because NaCl is a less expensive starting material than the oxide. Sodium hydroxide is among the top 10 chemicals in production in the United States, and this production was almost entirely by electrolysis of solutions of sodium chloride. This process is the chlor-alkali process, and it is the primary method for producing chlorine. Sodium hydroxide is an ionic compound and melts without decomposition. It is very soluble in water, giving off a great deal of heat and forming very basic solutions: 40 grams of sodium hydroxide dissolves in only 60 grams of water at 25 °C. Sodium hydroxide is employed in the production of other sodium compounds and is used to neutralize acidic solutions during the production of other chemicals such as petrochemicals and polymers. Figure Many of the applications of hydroxides are for the neutralization of acids (such as the antacid shown in 18.46) and for the preparation of oxides by thermal decomposition. An aqueous suspension of magnesium hydroxide constitutes the antacid milk of magnesia. Because of its ready availability (from the reaction of water with calcium oxide prepared by the decomposition of limestone, CaCO3), low cost, and activity, calcium hydroxide is used extensively in commercial applications needing a cheap, strong base. The reaction of hydroxides with appropriate acids is also used to prepare salts. https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

(credit: “Midnightcomm”/Wikimedia Commons) Chemistry in Everyday Life The Chlor-Alkali Process Although they are very different chemically, there is a link between chlorine and sodium hydroxide because there is an important electrochemical process that produces the two chemicals simultaneously. The process known as the chlor-alkali process, utilizes sodium chloride, which occurs in large deposits in many parts of the world. This is an electrochemical process to oxidize chloride ion to chlorine and generate sodium hydroxide. Passing a direct current of electricity through a solution of NaCl causes the chloride ions to migrate to the positive electrode where oxidation to gaseous chlorine occurs when the ion gives up an electron to the electrode: 2Cl−(aq) 2e− ⟶Cl2(g) + (at the positive electrode) The electrons produced travel through the outside electrical circuit to the negative electrode. Although the positive sodium ions migrate toward this negative electrode, metallic sodium does not form because sodium ions are too difficult to reduce under the conditions used. (Recall that metallic sodium is active enough to react with water and hence, even if produced, would immediately react with water to produce sodium ions again.) Instead, water molecules pick up electrons from the electrode and undergo reduction to form hydrogen gas and hydroxide ions: 2e−(from 2OH−(aq) 2H2 O(l) + the negative electrode) ⟶H2(g) + The overall result is the conversion of the aqueous solution of NaCl to an aqueous solution of NaOH, gaseous Cl2, and gaseous H2: electrolysis 2Na+(aq) 2Cl−(aq) 2Na+(aq) 2OH−(aq) ⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯ → + + 2H2 O(l) + + Cl2(g) + H2(g)

1044 Chapter 18 | Representative Metals, Metalloids, and Nonmetals Nonmetal Oxygen Compounds Most nonmetals react with oxygen to form nonmetal oxides. Depending on the available oxidation states for the element, a variety of oxides might form. Fluorine will combine with oxygen to form fluorides such as OF2, where the oxygen has a 2+-oxidation state. Sulfur Oxygen Compounds The two common oxides of sulfur are sulfur dioxide, SO2, and sulfur trioxide, SO3. The odor of burning sulfur comes Figure 18.47, from sulfur dioxide. Sulfur dioxide, shown in occurs in volcanic gases and in the atmosphere near industrial plants that burn fuel containing sulfur compounds. Figure 18.47 This image shows the molecular structure (left) and resonance forms (right) of sulfur dioxide. Commercial production of sulfur dioxide is from either burning sulfur or roasting sulfide ores such as ZnS, FeS2, and Cu2S in air. (Roasting, which forms the metal oxide, is the first step in the separation of many metals from their ores.) A convenient method for preparing sulfur dioxide in the laboratory is by the action of a strong acid on either sulfite 2−ion −. SO3 HSO3 salts containing the or hydrogen sulfite salts containing Sulfurous acid, H2SO3, forms first, but quickly decomposes into sulfur dioxide and water. Sulfur dioxide also forms when many reducing agents react with hot, concentrated sulfuric acid. Sulfur trioxide forms slowly when heating sulfur dioxide and oxygen together, and the reaction is exothermic: = −197.8 kJ 2SO2(g) + O2(g) ⟶2SO3(g) ΔH° Sulfur dioxide is a gas at room temperature, and the SO2 molecule is bent. Sulfur trioxide melts at 17 °C and boils Figure 18.48), at 43 °C. In the vapor state, its molecules are single SO3 units (shown in but in the solid state, SO3 exists in several polymeric forms. Figure 18.48 This image shows the structure (top) of sulfur trioxide in the gas phase and its resonance forms (bottom). The sulfur oxides react as Lewis acids with many oxides and hydroxides in Lewis acid-base reactions, with the formation of sulfites or hydrogen sulfites, and sulfates or hydrogen sulfates, respectively. https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

Chapter 18 | Representative Metals, Metalloids, and Nonmetals 1045 Halogen Oxygen Compounds The halogens do not react directly with oxygen, but it is possible to prepare binary oxygen-halogen compounds by the reactions of the halogens with oxygen-containing compounds. Oxygen compounds with chlorine, bromine, and iodine are oxides because oxygen is the more electronegative element in these compounds. On the other hand, fluorine compounds with oxygen are fluorides because fluorine is the more electronegative element. As a class, the oxides are extremely reactive and unstable, and their chemistry has little practical importance. Figure 18.49, Dichlorine oxide, formally called dichlorine monoxide, and chlorine dioxide, both shown in are the only commercially important compounds. They are important as bleaching agents (for use with pulp and flour) and for water treatment. Figure 18.49 This image shows the structures of the (a) Cl2O and (b) ClO2 molecules. Nonmetal Oxyacids and Their Salts Nonmetal oxides form acids when allowed to react with water; these are acid anhydrides. The resulting oxyanions can form salts with various metal ions. Nitrogen Oxyacids and Salts Nitrogen pentaoxide, N2O5, and NO2 react with water to form nitric acid, HNO3. Alchemists, as early as the eighth Figure 18.50) century, knew nitric acid (shown in as aqua fortis (meaning "strong water"). The acid was useful in the separation of gold from silver because it dissolves silver but not gold. Traces of nitric acid occur in the atmosphere after thunderstorms, and its salts are widely distributed in nature. There are tremendous deposits of Chile saltpeter, NaNO3, in the desert region near the boundary of Chile and Peru. Bengal saltpeter, KNO3, occurs in India and in other countries of the Far East. Figure 18.50 This image shows the molecular structure (left) of nitric acid, HNO3 and its resonance forms (right). In the laboratory, it is possible to produce nitric acid by heating a nitrate salt (such as sodium or potassium nitrate) with concentrated sulfuric acid: ⎯⎯Δ + HNO3(g) NaNO3(s) + H2 SO4(l) NaHSO4(s) →

1046 Chapter 18 | Representative Metals, Metalloids, and Nonmetals The Ostwald process is the commercial method for producing nitric acid. This process involves the oxidation of ammonia to nitric oxide, NO; oxidation of nitric oxide to nitrogen dioxide, NO2; and further oxidation and hydration of nitrogen dioxide to form nitric acid: 4NH3(g) + 5O2(g) ⟶4NO(g) + 6H2 O(g) 2NO(g) + O2(g) ⟶2NO2(g) 3NO2(g) + H2 O(l) ⟶2HNO3(aq) + NO(g) Or 4NO2(g) + O2(g) + 2H2 O(g) ⟶4HNO3(l) Pure nitric acid is a colorless liquid. However, it is often yellow or brown in color because NO2 forms as the acid decomposes. Nitric acid is stable in aqueous solution; solutions containing 68% of the acid are commercially available concentrated nitric acid. It is both a strong oxidizing agent and a strong acid. H+) The action of nitric acid on a metal rarely produces H2 (by reduction of in more than small amounts. Instead, the reduction of nitrogen occurs. The products formed depend on the concentration of the acid, the activity of the metal, and the temperature. Normally, a mixture of nitrates, nitrogen oxides, and various reduction products form. Less active metals such as copper, silver, and lead reduce concentrated nitric acid primarily to nitrogen dioxide. The reaction of dilute nitric acid with copper produces NO. In each case, the nitrate salts of the metals crystallize upon evaporation of the resultant solutions. Nonmetallic elements, such as sulfur, carbon, iodine, and phosphorus, undergo oxidation by concentrated nitric acid to their oxides or oxyacids, with the formation of NO2: 6NO2(g) + 2H2 O(l) S(s) + 6HNO3(aq) ⟶H2 SO4(aq) + 4NO2(g) + 2H2 O(l) C(s) + 4HNO3(aq) ⟶CO2(g) + Nitric acid oxidizes many compounds; for example, concentrated nitric acid readily oxidizes hydrochloric acid to chlorine and chlorine dioxide. A mixture of one part concentrated nitric acid and three parts concentrated hydrochloric acid (called aqua regia, which means royal water) reacts vigorously with metals. This mixture is particularly useful in dissolving gold, platinum, and other metals that are more difficult to oxidize than hydrogen. A simplified equation to represent the action of aqua regia on gold is: ⟶HAuCl4(aq) + 3NO2(g) + 3H2 O(l) Au(s) + 4HCl(aq) + 3HNO3(aq) Link to Learning Although gold is generally unreactive, you can watch a video (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/16gold) of the complex mixture of compounds present in aqua regia dissolving it into solution. Nitrates, salts of nitric acid, form when metals, oxides, hydroxides, or carbonates react with nitric acid. Most nitrates are soluble in water; indeed, one of the significant uses of nitric acid is to prepare soluble metal nitrates. Nitric acid finds extensive use in the laboratory and in chemical industries as a strong acid and strong oxidizing agent. It is important in the manufacture of explosives, dyes, plastics, and drugs. Salts of nitric acid (nitrates) are valuable as fertilizers. Gunpowder is a mixture of potassium nitrate, sulfur, and charcoal. https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

Chapter 18 | Representative Metals, Metalloids, and Nonmetals 1047 Figure The reaction of N2O3 with water gives a pale blue solution of nitrous acid, HNO2. However, HNO2 (shown in 18.51) is easier to prepare by the addition of an acid to a solution of nitrite; nitrous acid is a weak acid, so the nitrite ion is basic in aqueous solution: −(aq) O+(aq) + H2 O(l) NO2 + H3 ⟶HNO2(aq) Nitrous acid is very unstable and exists only in solution. It disproportionates slowly at room temperature (rapidly when heated) into nitric acid and nitric oxide. Nitrous acid is an active oxidizing agent with strong reducing agents, and strong oxidizing agents oxidize it to nitric acid. Figure 18.51 This image shows the molecular structure of a molecule of nitrous acid, HNO2. Sodium nitrite, NaNO2, is an additive to meats such as hot dogs and cold cuts. The nitrite ion has two functions. It limits the growth of bacteria that can cause food poisoning, and it prolongs the meat’s retention of its red color. The addition of sodium nitrite to meat products is controversial because nitrous acid reacts with certain organic compounds to form a class of compounds known as nitrosamines. Nitrosamines produce cancer in laboratory animals. This has prompted the FDA to limit the amount of NaNO2 in foods. The nitrites are much more stable than the acid, but nitrites, like nitrates, can explode. Nitrites, like nitrates, are also soluble in water (AgNO2 is only slightly soluble). Phosphorus Oxyacids and Salts Figure 18.52), Pure orthophosphoric acid, H3PO4 (shown in forms colorless, deliquescent crystals that melt at 42 °C. The common name of this compound is phosphoric acid, and is commercially available as a viscous 82% solution known as syrupy phosphoric acid. One use of phosphoric acid is as an additive to many soft drinks. One commercial method of preparing orthophosphoric acid is to treat calcium phosphate rock with concentrated sulfuric acid: Ca3 (PO4)2(s) + 3H2 SO4(aq) ⟶2H3 PO4(aq) + 3CaSO4(s) Figure 18.52 Orthophosphoric acid, H3PO4, is colorless when pure and has this molecular (left) and Lewis structure (right). Dilution of the products with water, followed by filtration to remove calcium sulfate, gives a dilute acid solution contaminated with calcium dihydrogen phosphate, Ca(H2PO4)2, and other compounds associated with calcium phosphate rock. It is possible to prepare pure orthophosphoric acid by dissolving P4O10 in water.

The action of water on P4O6, PCl3, PBr3, or PI3 forms phosphorous acid, H3PO3 (shown in The best method for preparing pure phosphorous acid is by hydrolyzing phosphorus trichloride: PCl3(l) + 3H2 O(l) ⟶H3 PO3(aq) + 3HCl(g) Heating the resulting solution expels the hydrogen chloride and leads to the evaporation of water. When sufficient water evaporates, white crystals of phosphorous acid will appear upon cooling. The crystals are deliquescent, very soluble in water, and have an odor like that of garlic. The solid melts at 70.1 °C and decomposes at about 200 °C by disproportionation into phosphine and orthophosphoric acid: 4H3 PO3(l) ⟶PH3(g) + 3H3 PO4(l) Figure 18.53 In a molecule of phosphorous acid, H3PO3, only the two hydrogen atoms bonded to an oxygen atom are acidic. −, H2 PO3 Phosphorous acid forms only two series of salts, which contain the dihydrogen phosphite ion, or the 2−, HPO3 hydrogen phosphate ion, respectively. It is not possible to replace the third atom of hydrogen because it is not very acidic, as it is not easy to ionize the P-H bond. Sulfur Oxyacids and Salts Figure 18.54), The preparation of sulfuric acid, H2SO4 (shown in begins with the oxidation of sulfur to sulfur trioxide and then converting the trioxide to sulfuric acid. Pure sulfuric acid is a colorless, oily liquid that freezes at 10.5 °C. It fumes when heated because the acid decomposes to water and sulfur trioxide. The heating process causes the loss of more sulfur trioxide than water, until reaching a concentration of 98.33% acid. Acid of this concentration boils at 338 °C without further change in concentration (a constant boiling solution) and is commercially concentrated H2SO4. The amount of sulfuric acid used in industry exceeds that of any other manufactured compound. Figure 18.54 Sulfuric acid has a tetrahedral molecular structure. The strong affinity of concentrated sulfuric acid for water makes it a good dehydrating agent. It is possible to dry gases and immiscible liquids that do not react with the acid by passing them through the acid. https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

Chapter 18 | Representative Metals, Metalloids, and Nonmetals 1049 Sulfuric acid is a strong diprotic acid that ionizes in two stages. In aqueous solution, the first stage is essentially −is HSO4 complete. The secondary ionization is not nearly so complete, and a moderately strong acid (about 25% −salt: 10−2). HSO4 × ionized in solution of a Ka = 1.2 Being a diprotic acid, sulfuric acid forms both sulfates, such as Na2SO4, and hydrogen sulfates, such as NaHSO4. Most sulfates are soluble in water; however, the sulfates of barium, strontium, calcium, and lead are only slightly soluble in water. −ion HSO4 Na2SO4⋅10H2O MgSO4⋅7H2O. is an Among the important sulfates are and Epsom salts, Because the acid, hydrogen sulfates, such as NaHSO4, exhibit acidic behavior, and this compound is the primary ingredient in some household cleansers. Hot, concentrated sulfuric acid is an oxidizing agent. Depending on its concentration, the temperature, and the strength of the reducing agent, sulfuric acid oxidizes many compounds and, in the process, undergoes reduction to −, 2−, S2−. HSO3 SO3 S, H2S, or SO2, Sulfur dioxide dissolves in water to form a solution of sulfurous acid, as expected for the oxide of a nonmetal. Sulfurous acid is unstable, and it is not possible to isolate anhydrous H2SO3. Heating a solution of sulfurous acid expels the sulfur dioxide. Like other diprotic acids, sulfurous acid ionizes in two steps: The hydrogen sulfite ion, −, 2−, HSO3 SO3 and the sulfite ion, form. Sulfurous acid is a moderately strong acid. Ionization is about 25% in 10−2 10−8). × × the first stage, but it is much less in the second (Ka1 = 1.2 and Ka2 = 6.2 In order to prepare solid sulfite and hydrogen sulfite salts, it is necessary to add a stoichiometric amount of a base to a sulfurous acid solution and then evaporate the water. These salts also form from the reaction of SO2 with oxides and hydroxides. Heating solid sodium hydrogen sulfite forms sodium sulfite, sulfur dioxide, and water: ⎯⎯Δ 2NaHSO3(s) Na2 SO3(s) + SO2(g) + H2 O(l) → Strong oxidizing agents can oxidize sulfurous acid. Oxygen in the air oxidizes it slowly to the more stable sulfuric acid: ⎯⎯Δ O+(aq) −(aq) + 2H2 O(l) 2H3 + 2HSO4 2H2 SO3(aq) + O2(g) → Solutions of sulfites are also very susceptible to air oxidation to produce sulfates. Thus, solutions of sulfites always contain sulfates after exposure to air. Halogen Oxyacids and Their Salts The compounds HXO, HXO2, HXO3, and HXO4, where X represents Cl, Br, or I, are the hypohalous, halous, halic, and perhalic acids, respectively.

This compound does not ionize in water, and there are no known salts. It is uncertain whether the name hypofluorous acid is even appropriate for HOF; a more appropriate name might be hydrogen hypofluorite. The reactions of chlorine and bromine with water are analogous to that of fluorine with ice, but these reactions do not go to completion, and mixtures of the halogen and the respective hypohalous and hydrohalic acids result. Other than HOF, the hypohalous acids only exist in solution. The hypohalous acids are all very weak acids; however, HOCl is a stronger acid than HOBr, which, in turn, is stronger than HOI. The addition of base to solutions of the hypohalous acids produces solutions of salts containing the basic hypohalite OX−. ions, It is possible to isolate these salts as solids. All of the hypohalites are unstable with respect to disproportionation in solution, but the reaction is slow for hypochlorite. Hypobromite and hypoiodite disproportionate rapidly, even in the cold: 3XO−(aq) −(aq) ⟶2X−(aq) + XO3 Sodium hypochlorite is an inexpensive bleach (Clorox) and germicide. The commercial preparation involves the electrolysis of cold, dilute, aqueous sodium chloride solutions under conditions where the resulting chlorine and hydroxide ion can react. The net reaction is: electrical energy Cl−(aq) ClO−(aq) ⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯ → + H2 O(l) + H2(g) The only definitely known halous acid is chlorous acid, HClO2, obtained by the reaction of barium chlorite with dilute sulfuric acid: Ba(ClO2)2(aq) + H2 SO4(aq) ⟶BaSO4(s) + 2HClO2(aq) Filtering the insoluble barium sulfate leaves a solution of HClO2. Chlorous acid is not stable; it slowly decomposes in solution to yield chlorine dioxide, hydrochloric acid, and water.

The acids react with bases to form salts containing chlorate ions (shown in Another preparative method is the electrochemical oxidation of a hot solution of a metal halide to form the appropriate metal chlorates. Sodium chlorate is a weed killer; potassium chlorate is used as an oxidizing agent. −, ClO3 Figure 18.56 Chlorate ions, are produced when halic acids react with bases. Perchloric acid, HClO4, forms when treating a perchlorate, such as potassium perchlorate, with sulfuric acid under reduced pressure. The HClO4 can be distilled from the mixture: SO4(aq) ⟶HClO4(g) + KHSO4(s) KClO4(s) + H2 Dilute aqueous solutions of perchloric acid are quite stable thermally, but concentrations above 60% are unstable and dangerous. Perchloric acid and its salts are powerful oxidizing agents, as the very electronegative chlorine is more stable in a lower oxidation state than 7+. Serious explosions have occurred when heating concentrated solutions with easily oxidized substances. However, its reactions as an oxidizing agent are slow when perchloric acid is cold Figure and dilute. The acid is among the strongest of all acids. Most salts containing the perchlorate ion (shown in 18.57) are soluble. It is possible to prepare them from reactions of bases with perchloric acid and, commercially, by the electrolysis of hot solutions of their chlorides.

Perbromate salts are difficult to prepare, and the best syntheses currently involve the oxidation of bromates in basic solution with fluorine gas followed by acidification. There are few, if any, commercial uses of this acid or its salts. There are several different acids containing iodine in the 7+-oxidation state; they include metaperiodic acid, HIO4, and paraperiodic acid, H5IO6. These acids are strong oxidizing agents and react with bases to form the appropriate salts. 18.10 Occurrence, Preparation, and Properties of Sulfur By the end of this section, you will be able to: Describe the properties, preparation, and uses of sulfur • Sulfur exists in nature as elemental deposits as well as sulfides of iron, zinc, lead, and copper, and sulfates of sodium, calcium, barium, and magnesium. Hydrogen sulfide is often a component of natural gas and occurs in many volcanic Figure 18.58. gases, like those shown in Sulfur is a constituent of many proteins and is essential for life.

Chapter 18 | Representative Metals, Metalloids, and Nonmetals 1053 Figure 18.59, The Frasch process, illustrated in is important in the mining of free sulfur from enormous underground deposits in Texas and Louisiana. Superheated water (170 °C and 10 atm pressure) is forced down the outermost of three concentric pipes to the underground deposit. The hot water melts the sulfur. The innermost pipe conducts compressed air into the liquid sulfur. The air forces the liquid sulfur, mixed with air, to flow up through the outlet pipe. Transferring the mixture to large settling vats allows the solid sulfur to separate upon cooling. This sulfur is 99.5% to 99.9% pure and requires no purification for most uses. Figure 18.59 The Frasch process is used to mine sulfur from underground deposits. Larger amounts of sulfur also come from hydrogen sulfide recovered during the purification of natural gas. Sulfur exists in several allotropic forms. The stable form at room temperature contains eight-membered rings, and so the true formula is S8. However, chemists commonly use S to simplify the coefficients in chemical equations; we will follow this practice in this book.

1054 Chapter 18 | Representative Metals, Metalloids, and Nonmetals Like oxygen, which is also a member of group 16, sulfur exhibits a distinctly nonmetallic behavior. It oxidizes metals, giving a variety of binary sulfides in which sulfur exhibits a negative oxidation state (2−). Elemental sulfur oxidizes less electronegative nonmetals, and more electronegative nonmetals, such as oxygen and the halogens, will oxidize it. Other strong oxidizing agents also oxidize sulfur. For example, concentrated nitric acid oxidizes sulfur to the sulfate ion, with the concurrent formation of nitrogen(IV) oxide: O+(aq) 2−(aq) S(s) + 6HNO3(aq) ⟶2H3 + SO4 + 6NO2(g) The chemistry of sulfur with an oxidation state of 2−is similar to that of oxygen. Unlike oxygen, however, sulfur forms many compounds in which it exhibits positive oxidation states. 18.11 Occurrence, Preparation, and Properties of Halogens By the end of this section, you will be able to: Describe the preparation, properties, and uses of halogens • Describe the properties, preparation, and uses of halogen compounds • The elements in group 17 are the halogens. These are the elements fluorine, chlorine, bromine, iodine, and astatine. These elements are too reactive to occur freely in nature, but their compounds are widely distributed. Chlorides are the most abundant; although fluorides, bromides, and iodides are less common, they are reasonably available. In this section, we will examine the occurrence, preparation, and properties of halogens. Next, we will examine halogen compounds with the representative metals followed by an examination of the interhalogens. This section will conclude with some applications of halogens. Occurrence and Preparation All of the halogens occur in seawater as halide ions. The concentration of the chloride ion is 0.54 M; that of the other 10–4 halides is less than M. Fluoride also occurs in minerals such as CaF2, Ca(PO4)3F, and Na3AlF6. Chloride also occurs in the Great Salt Lake and the Dead Sea, and in extensive salt beds that contain NaCl, KCl, or MgCl2. Part of the chlorine in your body is present as hydrochloric acid, which is a component of stomach acid. Bromine compounds occur in the Dead Sea and underground brines. Iodine compounds are found in small quantities in Chile saltpeter, underground brines, and sea kelp. Iodine is essential to the function of the thyroid gland. The best sources of halogens (except iodine) are halide salts. It is possible to oxidize the halide ions to free diatomic halogen molecules by various methods, depending on the ease of oxidation of the halide ion. Fluoride is the most difficult to oxidize, whereas iodide is the easiest. The major method for preparing fluorine is electrolytic oxidation. The most common electrolysis procedure is to use a molten mixture of potassium hydrogen fluoride, KHF2, and anhydrous hydrogen fluoride. Electrolysis causes HF to decompose, forming fluorine gas at the anode and hydrogen at the cathode. It is necessary to keep the two gases separated to prevent their explosive recombination to reform hydrogen fluoride. Most commercial chlorine comes from the electrolysis of the chloride ion in aqueous solutions of sodium chloride; this is the chlor-alkali process discussed previously. Chlorine is also a product of the electrolytic production of metals such as sodium, calcium, and magnesium from their fused chlorides. It is also possible to prepare chlorine by the chemical oxidation of the chloride ion in acid solution with strong oxidizing agents such as manganese dioxide (MnO2) or sodium dichromate (Na2Cr2O7). The reaction with manganese dioxide is: ⟶Mn2+(aq) 2Cl−(aq) O+(aq) MnO2(s) + + 4H3 + Cl2(g) + 6H2 O(l) The commercial preparation of bromine involves the oxidation of bromide ion by chlorine: https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

Chapter 18 | Representative Metals, Metalloids, and Nonmetals 1055 2Cl−(aq) 2Br−(aq) + Cl2(g) ⟶Br2(l) + Chlorine is a stronger oxidizing agent than bromine. This method is important for the production of essentially all domestic bromine. Some iodine comes from the oxidation of iodine chloride, ICl, or iodic acid, HlO3. The commercial preparation of iodine utilizes the reduction of sodium iodate, NaIO3, an impurity in deposits of Chile saltpeter, with sodium hydrogen sulfite: −(aq) −(aq) −(aq) 2−(aq) 2IO3 + 5HSO3 ⟶3HSO4 + 2SO4 + H2 O(l) + I2(s) Properties of the Halogens Fluorine is a pale yellow gas, chlorine is a greenish-yellow gas, bromine is a deep reddish-brown liquid, and iodine is a grayish-black crystalline solid. Liquid bromine has a high vapor pressure, and the reddish vapor is readily visible Figure 18.60. in Iodine crystals have a noticeable vapor pressure. When gently heated, these crystals sublime and form a beautiful deep violet vapor. Figure 18.60 Chlorine is a pale yellow-green gas (left), gaseous bromine is deep orange (center), and gaseous iodine is purple (right). (Fluorine is so reactive that it is too dangerous to handle.) (credit: Sahar Atwa) Bromine is only slightly soluble in water, but it is miscible in all proportions in less polar (or nonpolar) solvents such as chloroform, carbon tetrachloride, and carbon disulfide, forming solutions that vary from yellow to reddish-brown, depending on the concentration. Iodine is soluble in chloroform, carbon tetrachloride, carbon disulfide, and many hydrocarbons, giving violet solutions of I2 molecules. Iodine dissolves only slightly in water, giving brown solutions. It is quite soluble in aqueous solutions of iodides, with which it forms brown solutions. These brown solutions result because iodine molecules have empty valence d orbitals and can act as weak Lewis acids towards the iodide ion. The equation for the reversible −, I3 reaction of iodine (Lewis acid) with the iodide ion (Lewis base) to form triiodide ion, is: I−(aq) −(aq) I2(s) + ⟶I3 The easier it is to oxidize the halide ion, the more difficult it is for the halogen to act as an oxidizing agent. Fluorine generally oxidizes an element to its highest oxidation state, whereas the heavier halogens may not. For example, when excess fluorine reacts with sulfur, SF6 forms. Chlorine gives SCl2 and bromine, S2Br2. Iodine does not react with sulfur. Fluorine is the most powerful oxidizing agent of the known elements. It spontaneously oxidizes most other elements; therefore, the reverse reaction, the oxidation of fluorides, is very difficult to accomplish. Fluorine reacts directly and forms binary fluorides with all of the elements except the lighter noble gases (He, Ne, and Ar). Fluorine is such a 

--- Page 1064 ---
1056 Chapter 18 | Representative Metals, Metalloids, and Nonmetals strong oxidizing agent that many substances ignite on contact with it. Drops of water inflame in fluorine and form O2, OF2, H2O2, O3, and HF. Wood and asbestos ignite and burn in fluorine gas. Most hot metals burn vigorously in fluorine. However, it is possible to handle fluorine in copper, iron, or nickel containers because an adherent film of the fluoride salt passivates their surfaces. Fluorine is the only element that reacts directly with the noble gas xenon. Although it is a strong oxidizing agent, chlorine is less active than fluorine. Mixing chlorine and hydrogen in the dark makes the reaction between them to be imperceptibly slow. Exposure of the mixture to light causes the two to react explosively. Chlorine is also less active towards metals than fluorine, and oxidation reactions usually require higher temperatures. Molten sodium ignites in chlorine. Chlorine attacks most nonmetals (C, N2, and O2 are notable exceptions), forming covalent molecular compounds. Chlorine generally reacts with compounds that contain only carbon and hydrogen (hydrocarbons) by adding to multiple bonds or by substitution. In cold water, chlorine undergoes a disproportionation reaction: O+(aq) Cl−(aq) Cl2(aq) + 2H2 O(l) ⟶HOCl(aq) + H3 + Half the chlorine atoms oxidize to the 1+ oxidation state (hypochlorous acid), and the other half reduce to the 1− oxidation state (chloride ion). This disproportionation is incomplete, so chlorine water is an equilibrium mixture of chlorine molecules, hypochlorous acid molecules, hydronium ions, and chloride ions. When exposed to light, this solution undergoes a photochemical decomposition: sunlight O+(aq) 2Cl−(aq) 2H3 + + O2(g) 2HOCl(aq) + 2H2 O(l) ⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯ → The nonmetal chlorine is more electronegative than any other element except fluorine, oxygen, and nitrogen. In general, very electronegative elements are good oxidizing agents; therefore, we would expect elemental chlorine to oxidize all of the other elements except for these three (and the nonreactive noble gases). Its oxidizing property, in fact, is responsible for its principal use. For example, phosphorus(V) chloride, an important intermediate in the preparation of insecticides and chemical weapons, is manufactured by oxidizing the phosphorus with chlorine: P4(s) + 10Cl2(g) ⟶4PCl5(l) A great deal of chlorine is also used to oxidize, and thus to destroy, organic or biological materials in water purification and in bleaching. The chemical properties of bromine are similar to those of chlorine, although bromine is the weaker oxidizing agent and its reactivity is less than that of chlorine. Iodine is the least reactive of the halogens. It is the weakest oxidizing agent, and the iodide ion is the most easily oxidized halide ion. Iodine reacts with metals, but heating is often required. It does not oxidize other halide ions. Compared with the other halogens, iodine reacts only slightly with water. Traces of iodine in water react with a mixture of starch and iodide ion, forming a deep blue color. This reaction is a very sensitive test for the presence of iodine in water. Halides of the Representative Metals Thousands of salts of the representative metals have been prepared. The binary halides are an important subclass of salts. A salt is an ionic compound composed of cations and anions, other than hydroxide or oxide ions. In general, it is possible to prepare these salts from the metals or from oxides, hydroxides, or carbonates. We will illustrate the general types of reactions for preparing salts through reactions used to prepare binary halides. The binary compounds of a metal with the halogens are the halides. Most binary halides are ionic. However, mercury, the elements of group 13 with oxidation states of 3+, tin(IV), and lead(IV) form covalent binary halides. The direct reaction of a metal and a halogen produce the halide of the metal. Examples of these oxidation-reduction reactions include: Cd(s) + Cl2(g) ⟶CdCl2(s) https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

Chapter 18 | Representative Metals, Metalloids, and Nonmetals 1057 2Ga(l) 3Br2(l) ⟶2GaBr3(s) + Link to Learning Reactions of the alkali metals with elemental halogens are very exothermic and often quite violent. Under controlled conditions, they provide exciting demonstrations for budding students of chemistry. You can view the initial heating (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/16sodium) of the sodium that removes the coating of sodium hydroxide, sodium peroxide, and residual mineral oil to expose the reactive surface. The reaction with chlorine gas then proceeds very nicely. If a metal can exhibit two oxidation states, it may be necessary to control the stoichiometry in order to obtain the halide with the lower oxidation state. For example, preparation of tin(II) chloride requires a 1:1 ratio of Sn to Cl2, whereas preparation of tin(IV) chloride requires a 1:2 ratio: Sn(s) + Cl2(g) ⟶SnCl2(s) Sn(s) + 2Cl2(g) ⟶SnCl4(l) The active representative metals—those that are easier to oxidize than hydrogen—react with gaseous hydrogen halides to produce metal halides and hydrogen. The reaction of zinc with hydrogen fluoride is: H2(g) Zn(s) + 2HF(g) ⟶ZnF2(s) + The active representative metals also react with solutions of hydrogen halides to form hydrogen and solutions of the corresponding halides. Examples of such reactions include: + H2(g) Cd(s) + 2HBr(aq) ⟶CdBr2(aq) + H2(g) Sn(s) + 2HI(aq) ⟶SnI2(aq) Hydroxides, carbonates, and some oxides react with solutions of the hydrogen halides to form solutions of halide salts. It is possible to prepare additional salts by the reaction of these hydroxides, carbonates, and oxides with aqueous solution of other acids: + CO2(g) + H2 O(l) CaCo3(s) + 2HCl(aq) ⟶CaCl2(aq) TlOH(aq) + HF(aq) ⟶TlF(aq) + H2 O(l) A few halides and many of the other salts of the representative metals are insoluble. It is possible to prepare these Figure 18.61). soluble salts by metathesis reactions that occur when solutions of soluble salts are mixed (see Metathesis reactions are examined in the chapter on the stoichiometry of chemical reactions.

For example, magnesium chloride in the ocean is the source of magnesium ions used in the production of magnesium. Figure 18.62, Large underground deposits of sodium chloride, like the salt mine shown in occur in many parts of the world. These deposits serve as the source of sodium and chlorine in almost all other compounds containing these elements. The chlor-alkali process is one example.

Table 18.3 Note from that fluorine is able to oxidize iodine to its maximum oxidation state, 7+, whereas bromine and chlorine, which are more difficult to oxidize, achieve only the 5+-oxidation state. A 7+-oxidation state is the limit for the halogens. Because smaller halogens are grouped about a larger one, the maximum number of smaller atoms possible increases as the radius of the larger atom increases. Many of these compounds are unstable, and most are extremely reactive. The interhalogens react like their component halides; halogen fluorides, for example, are stronger oxidizing agents than are halogen chlorides. The ionic polyhalides of the alkali metals, such as KI3, KICl2, KICl4, CsIBr2, and CsBrCl2, which contain an anion composed of at least three halogen atoms, are closely related to the interhalogens.

Fluoride partially converts teeth from Ca5(PO4)3(OH) into Ca5(PO4)3F. Chlorine is important to bleach wood pulp and cotton cloth. The chlorine reacts with water to form hypochlorous acid, which oxidizes colored substances to colorless ones. Large quantities of chlorine are important in chlorinating hydrocarbons (replacing hydrogen with chlorine) to produce compounds such as tetrachloride (CCl4), chloroform (CHCl3), and ethyl chloride (C2H5Cl), and in the production of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and other polymers. Chlorine is also important to kill the bacteria in community water supplies. Bromine is important in the production of certain dyes, and sodium and potassium bromides are used as sedatives. At one time, light-sensitive silver bromide was a component of photographic film. Iodine in alcohol solution with potassium iodide is an antiseptic (tincture of iodine). Iodide salts are essential for the proper functioning of the thyroid gland; an iodine deficiency may lead to the development of a goiter. Iodized table salt contains 0.023% potassium iodide. Silver iodide is useful in the seeding of clouds to induce rain; it was important in the production of photographic film and iodoform, CHI3, is an antiseptic. 18.12 Occurrence, Preparation, and Properties of the Noble Gases By the end of this section, you will be able to: Describe the properties, preparation, and uses of the noble gases • The elements in group 18 are the noble gases (helium, neon, argon, krypton, xenon, and radon). They earned the name “noble” because they were assumed to be nonreactive since they have filled valence shells. In 1962, Dr. Neil Bartlett at the University of British Columbia proved this assumption to be false. These elements are present in the atmosphere in small amounts. Some natural gas contains 1–2% helium by mass. Helium is isolated from natural gas by liquefying the condensable components, leaving only helium as a gas. The United States possesses most of the world’s commercial supply of this element in its helium-bearing gas fields. Argon, neon, krypton, and xenon come from the fractional distillation of liquid air. Radon comes from other radioactive elements. More recently, it was observed that this radioactive gas is present in very small amounts in soils and minerals. Its accumulation in well-insulated, tightly sealed buildings, however, constitutes a health hazard, primarily lung cancer. The boiling points and melting points of the noble gases are extremely low relative to those of other substances of comparable atomic or molecular masses. This is because only weak London dispersion forces are present, and these forces can hold the atoms together only when molecular motion is very slight, as it is at very low temperatures. Helium is the only substance known that does not solidify on cooling at normal pressure. It remains liquid close to absolute zero (0.001 K) at ordinary pressures, but it solidifies under elevated pressure. Helium is used for filling balloons and lighter-than-air craft because it does not burn, making it safer to use than hydrogen. Helium at high pressures is not a narcotic like nitrogen. Thus, mixtures of oxygen and helium are important for divers working under high pressures. Using a helium-oxygen mixture avoids the disoriented mental state known as nitrogen narcosis, the so-called rapture of the deep. Helium is important as an inert atmosphere for the melting and welding of easily oxidizable metals and for many chemical processes that are sensitive to air. Liquid helium (boiling point, 4.2 K) is an important coolant to reach the low temperatures necessary for cryogenic research, and it is essential for achieving the low temperatures necessary to produce superconduction in traditional superconducting materials used in powerful magnets and other devices. This cooling ability is necessary for the magnets used for magnetic resonance imaging, a common medical diagnostic procedure. The other common coolant is liquid nitrogen (boiling point, 77 K), which is significantly cheaper. https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

Chapter 18 | Representative Metals, Metalloids, and Nonmetals 1061 Neon is a component of neon lamps and signs. Passing an electric spark through a tube containing neon at low pressure generates the familiar red glow of neon. It is possible to change the color of the light by mixing argon or mercury vapor with the neon or by utilizing glass tubes of a special color. Argon was useful in the manufacture of gas-filled electric light bulbs, where its lower heat conductivity and chemical inertness made it preferable to nitrogen for inhibiting the vaporization of the tungsten filament and prolonging the life of the bulb. Fluorescent tubes commonly contain a mixture of argon and mercury vapor. Argon is the third most abundant gas in dry air. Krypton-xenon flash tubes are used to take high-speed photographs. An electric discharge through such a tube gives 1 a very intense light that lasts only of a second. Krypton forms a difluoride, KrF2, which is thermally unstable 50,000 at room temperature. Stable compounds of xenon form when xenon reacts with fluorine. Xenon difluoride, XeF2, forms after heating an excess of xenon gas with fluorine gas and then cooling. The material forms colorless crystals, which are stable at room temperature in a dry atmosphere. Xenon tetrafluoride, XeF4, and xenon hexafluoride, XeF6, are prepared in an analogous manner, with a stoichiometric amount of fluorine and an excess of fluorine, respectively. Compounds with oxygen are prepared by replacing fluorine atoms in the xenon fluorides with oxygen. When XeF6 reacts with water, a solution of XeO3 results and the xenon remains in the 6+-oxidation state: + 6HF(aq) XeF6(s) + 3H2 O(l) ⟶XeO3(aq) Dry, solid xenon trioxide, XeO3, is extremely explosive—it will spontaneously detonate. Both XeF6 and XeO3 4−, XeO6 disproportionate in basic solution, producing xenon, oxygen, and salts of the perxenate ion, in which xenon reaches its maximum oxidation sate of 8+. Radon apparently forms RnF2—evidence of this compound comes from radiochemical tracer techniques. Unstable compounds of argon form at low temperatures, but stable compounds of helium and neon are not known.

--- Page 1072 ---
1064 Chapter 18 | Representative Metals, Metalloids, and Nonmetals representative metals, metalloids, and nonmetals. The alkali metals (group 1) are very reactive, readily form ions with a charge of 1+ to form ionic compounds that are usually soluble in water, and react vigorously with water to form hydrogen gas and a basic solution of the metal hydroxide. The outermost electrons of the alkaline earth metals (group 2) are more difficult to remove than the outer electron of the alkali metals, leading to the group 2 metals being less reactive than those in group 1. These elements easily form compounds in which the metals exhibit an oxidation state of 2+. Zinc, cadmium, and mercury (group 12) commonly exhibit the group oxidation state of 2+ (although mercury 2+). Hg2 also exhibits an oxidation state of 1+ in compounds that contain Aluminum, gallium, indium, and thallium (group 13) are easier to oxidize than is hydrogen. Aluminum, gallium, and indium occur with an oxidation state 3+ Tl+ (however, thallium also commonly occurs as the ion). Tin and lead form stable divalent cations and covalent compounds in which the metals exhibit the 4+-oxidation state. 18.2 Occurrence and Preparation of the Representative Metals Because of their chemical reactivity, it is necessary to produce the representative metals in their pure forms by reduction from naturally occurring compounds. Electrolysis is important in the production of sodium, potassium, and aluminum. Chemical reduction is the primary method for the isolation of magnesium, zinc, and tin. Similar procedures are important for the other representative metals. 18.3 Structure and General Properties of the Metalloids The elements boron, silicon, germanium, arsenic, antimony, and tellurium separate the metals from the nonmetals in the periodic table. These elements, called metalloids or sometimes semimetals, exhibit properties characteristic of both metals and nonmetals. The structures of these elements are similar in many ways to those of nonmetals, but the elements are electrical semiconductors. 18.4 Structure and General Properties of the Nonmetals Nonmetals have structures that are very different from those of the metals, primarily because they have greater electronegativity and electrons that are more tightly bound to individual atoms. Most nonmetal oxides are acid anhydrides, meaning that they react with water to form acidic solutions. Molecular structures are common for most of the nonmetals, and several have multiple allotropes with varying physical properties. 18.5 Occurrence, Preparation, and Compounds of Hydrogen Hydrogen is the most abundant element in the universe and its chemistry is truly unique. Although it has some chemical reactivity that is similar to that of the alkali metals, hydrogen has many of the same chemical properties of a nonmetal with a relatively low electronegativity. It forms ionic hydrides with active metals, covalent compounds in which it has an oxidation state of 1−with less electronegative elements, and covalent compounds in which it has an oxidation state of 1+ with more electronegative nonmetals. It reacts explosively with oxygen, fluorine, and chlorine, less readily with bromine, and much less readily with iodine, sulfur, and nitrogen. Hydrogen reduces the oxides of metals with lower reduction potentials than chromium to form the metal and water. The hydrogen halides are all acidic when dissolved in water. 18.6 Occurrence, Preparation, and Properties of Carbonates The usual method for the preparation of the carbonates of the alkali and alkaline earth metals is by reaction of an oxide or hydroxide with carbon dioxide. Other carbonates form by precipitation. Metal carbonates or hydrogen carbonates such as limestone (CaCO3), the antacid Tums (CaCO3), and baking soda (NaHCO3) are common examples. Carbonates and hydrogen carbonates decompose in the presence of acids and most decompose on heating. 18.7 Occurrence, Preparation, and Properties of Nitrogen Nitrogen exhibits oxidation states ranging from 3−to 5+. Because of the stability of the N≡N triple bond, it requires a great deal of energy to make compounds from molecular nitrogen. Active metals such as the alkali metals and alkaline earth metals can reduce nitrogen to form metal nitrides. Nitrogen oxides and nitrogen hydrides are also important substances. https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

Chapter 18 | Representative Metals, Metalloids, and Nonmetals 1065 18.8 Occurrence, Preparation, and Properties of Phosphorus Phosphorus (group 15) commonly exhibits oxidation states of 3−with active metals and of 3+ and 5+ with more electronegative nonmetals. The halogens and oxygen will oxidize phosphorus. The oxides are phosphorus(V) oxide, P4O10, and phosphorus(III) oxide, P4O6. The two common methods for preparing orthophosphoric acid, H3PO4, are either the reaction of a phosphate with sulfuric acid or the reaction of water with phosphorus(V) oxide. Orthophosphoric acid is a triprotic acid that forms three types of salts. 18.9 Occurrence, Preparation, and Compounds of Oxygen Oxygen is one of the most reactive elements. This reactivity, coupled with its abundance, makes the chemistry of oxygen very rich and well understood. Compounds of the representative metals with oxygen exist in three categories (1) oxides, (2) peroxides and superoxides, and (3) hydroxides. Heating the corresponding hydroxides, nitrates, or carbonates is the most common method for producing oxides. Heating the metal or metal oxide in oxygen may lead to the formation of peroxides and superoxides. The soluble oxides dissolve in water to form solutions of hydroxides. Most metals oxides are base anhydrides and react with acids. The hydroxides of the representative metals react with acids in acid-base reactions to form salts and water. The hydroxides have many commercial uses. All nonmetals except fluorine form multiple oxides. Nearly all of the nonmetal oxides are acid anhydrides. The acidity of oxyacids requires that the hydrogen atoms bond to the oxygen atoms in the molecule rather than to the other nonmetal atom. Generally, the strength of the oxyacid increases with the number of oxygen atoms bonded to the nonmetal atom and not to a hydrogen. 18.10 Occurrence, Preparation, and Properties of Sulfur S2−, Sulfur (group 16) reacts with almost all metals and readily forms the sulfide ion, in which it has as oxidation state of 2−. Sulfur reacts with most nonmetals. 18.11 Occurrence, Preparation, and Properties of Halogens The halogens form halides with less electronegative elements. Halides of the metals vary from ionic to covalent; halides of nonmetals are covalent. Interhalogens form by the combination of two or more different halogens. All of the representative metals react directly with elemental halogens or with solutions of the hydrohalic acids (HF, HCl, HBr, and HI) to produce representative metal halides. Other laboratory preparations involve the addition of aqueous hydrohalic acids to compounds that contain such basic anions, such as hydroxides, oxides, or carbonates. 18.12 Occurrence, Preparation, and Properties of the Noble Gases The most significant property of the noble gases (group 18) is their inactivity. They occur in low concentrations in the atmosphere. They find uses as inert atmospheres, neon signs, and as coolants. The three heaviest noble gases react with fluorine to form fluorides. The xenon fluorides are the best characterized as the starting materials for a few other noble gas compounds. Exercises 18.1 Periodicity 1.

Iron occurs everywhere—from the rings in your spiral notebook and the cutlery in your kitchen to automobiles, ships, buildings, and in the hemoglobin in your blood. Titanium is useful in the manufacture of lightweight, durable products such as bicycle frames, artificial hips, and jewelry. Chromium is useful as a protective plating on plumbing fixtures and automotive detailing. In addition to being used in their pure elemental forms, many compounds containing transition metals have numerous other applications. Silver nitrate is used to create mirrors, zirconium silicate provides friction in automotive brakes, and many important cancer-fighting agents, like the drug cisplatin and related species, are platinum compounds. The variety of properties exhibited by transition metals is due to their complex valence shells. Unlike most main group metals where one oxidation state is normally observed, the valence shell structure of transition metals means that they usually occur in several different stable oxidation states. In addition, electron transitions in these elements can correspond with absorption of photons in the visible electromagnetic spectrum, leading to colored compounds. Because of these behaviors, transition metals exhibit a rich and fascinating chemistry.

1078 Chapter 19 | Transition Metals and Coordination Chemistry 19.1 Occurrence, Preparation, and Properties of Transition Metals and Their Compounds By the end of this section, you will be able to: Outline the general approach for the isolation of transition metals from natural sources • Describe typical physical and chemical properties of the transition metals • Identify simple compound classes for transition metals and describe their chemical properties • Transition metals are defined as those elements that have (or readily form) partially filled d orbitals. As shown in Figure 19.2, the d-block elements in groups 3–11 are transition elements. The f-block elements, also called inner transition metals (the lanthanides and actinides), also meet this criterion because the d orbital is partially occupied before the f orbitals. The d orbitals fill with the copper family (group 11); for this reason, the next family (group 12) are technically not transition elements. However, the group 12 elements do display some of the same chemical properties and are commonly included in discussions of transition metals. Some chemists do treat the group 12 elements as transition metals. Figure 19.2 The transition metals are located in groups 3–11 of the periodic table. The inner transition metals are in the two rows below the body of the table. https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

Chapter 19 | Transition Metals and Coordination Chemistry 1079 The d-block elements are divided into the first transition series (the elements Sc through Cu), the second transition series (the elements Y through Ag), and the third transition series (the element La and the elements Hf through Au). Actinium, Ac, is the first member of the fourth transition series, which also includes Rf through Rg. The f-block elements are the elements Ce through Lu, which constitute the lanthanide series (or lanthanoid series), and the elements Th through Lr, which constitute the actinide series (or actinoid series). Because lanthanum behaves very much like the lanthanide elements, it is considered a lanthanide element, even though its electron configuration makes it the first member of the third transition series. Similarly, the behavior of actinium means it is part of the actinide series, although its electron configuration makes it the first member of the fourth transition series. Example 19.1 Valence Electrons in Transition Metals Review how to write electron configurations, covered in the chapter on electronic structure and periodic properties of elements. Recall that for the transition and inner transition metals, it is necessary to remove the s electrons before the d or f electrons.

There are 17 rare earth elements, consisting of the 15 lanthanoids plus scandium and yttrium. They are called rare because they were once difficult to extract economically, so it was rare to have a pure sample; due to similar chemical properties, it is difficult to separate any one lanthanide from the others. However, newer separation methods, such as ion exchange resins similar to those found in home water softeners, make the separation of these elements easier and more economical. Most ores that contain these elements have low concentrations of all the rare earth elements mixed together. The commercial applications of lanthanides are growing rapidly. For example, europium is important in flat screen displays found in computer monitors, cell phones, and televisions. Neodymium is useful in laptop hard drives and in the processes that convert crude oil into gasoline (Figure 19.3). Holmium is found in dental and medical equipment. In addition, many alternative energy technologies rely heavily on lanthanoids. Neodymium and dysprosium are key components of hybrid vehicle engines and the magnets used in wind turbines. Figure 19.3 (a) Europium is used in display screens for televisions, computer monitors, and cell phones. (b) Neodymium magnets are commonly found in computer hard drives. (credit b: modification of work by “KUERT Datenrettung”/Flickr) As the demand for lanthanide materials has increased faster than supply, prices have also increased. In 2008, dysprosium cost $110/kg; by 2014, the price had increased to $470/kg. Increasing the supply of lanthanoid elements is one of the most significant challenges facing the industries that rely on the optical and magnetic properties of these materials. The transition elements have many properties in common with other metals. They are almost all hard, high-melting solids that conduct heat and electricity well. They readily form alloys and lose electrons to form stable cations. In addition, transition metals form a wide variety of stable coordination compounds, in which the central metal atom or ion acts as a Lewis acid and accepts one or more pairs of electrons. Many different molecules and ions can donate lone pairs to the metal center, serving as Lewis bases. In this chapter, we shall focus primarily on the chemical behavior of the elements of the first transition series. Properties of the Transition Elements Transition metals demonstrate a wide range of chemical behaviors. As can be seen from their reduction potentials Appendix H), (see some transition metals are strong reducing agents, whereas others have very low reactivity. For example, the lanthanides all form stable 3+ aqueous cations.

Their ability to resist oxidation makes them useful materials for constructing circuits and jewelry. Cr3+, Fe3+, Co2+, Ions of the lighter d-block elements, such as and form colorful hydrated ions that are stable in (Mo3+, Ru3+, Ir2+) water. However, ions in the period just below these and are unstable and react readily with oxygen from the air. The majority of simple, water-stable ions formed by the heavier d-block elements are oxyanions such as 2−and −. MoO4 ReO4 Ruthenium, osmium, rhodium, iridium, palladium, and platinum are the platinum metals. With difficulty, they form simple cations that are stable in water, and, unlike the earlier elements in the second and third transition series, they do not form stable oxyanions. Both the d- and f-block elements react with nonmetals to form binary compounds; heating is often required. These elements react with halogens to form a variety of halides ranging in oxidation state from 1+ to 6+. On heating, oxygen reacts with all of the transition elements except palladium, platinum, silver, and gold. The oxides of these latter metals can be formed using other reactants, but they decompose upon heating. The f-block elements, the elements of group 3, and the elements of the first transition series except copper react with aqueous solutions of acids, forming hydrogen gas and solutions of the corresponding salts. Transition metals can form compounds with a wide range of oxidation states. Some of the observed oxidation states Figure 19.4. of the elements of the first transition series are shown in As we move from left to right across the first transition series, we see that the number of common oxidation states increases at first to a maximum towards the middle of the table, then decreases. The values in the table are typical values; there are other known values, and it is possible to synthesize new additions. For example, in 2014, researchers were successful in synthesizing a new oxidation state of iridium (9+). Figure 19.4 Transition metals of the first transition series can form compounds with varying oxidation states. For the elements scandium through manganese (the first half of the first transition series), the highest oxidation state corresponds to the loss of all of the electrons in both the s and d orbitals of their valence shells. The titanium(IV) ion, for example, is formed when the titanium atom loses its two 3d and two 4s electrons. These highest oxidation states are the most stable forms of scandium, titanium, and vanadium. However, it is not possible to continue to remove all of the valence electrons from metals as we continue through the series. Iron is known to form oxidation states from 2+ to 6+, with iron(II) and iron(III) being the most common. Most of the elements of the first transition series form ions with a charge of 2+ or 3+ that are stable in water, although those of the early members of the series can be readily oxidized by air. The elements of the second and third transition series generally are more stable in higher oxidation states than are the elements of the first series. In general, the atomic radius increases down a group, which leads to the ions of the second and third series being larger than are those in the first series. Removing electrons from orbitals that are located farther from the nucleus is easier than removing electrons close to the nucleus. For example, molybdenum and tungsten, members of group 6, are limited mostly to an oxidation state of 6+ in aqueous solution. Chromium, Cr3+ Cr2+ the lightest member of the group, forms stable ions in water and, in the absence of air, less stable ions.

Molybdenum and tungsten form sulfides in which the metals exhibit oxidation states of 4+ and 6+. Example 19.2 Activity of the Transition Metals Which is the strongest oxidizing agent in acidic solution: dichromate ion, which contains chromium(VI), permanganate ion, which contains manganese(VII), or titanium dioxide, which contains titanium(IV)? Solution Appendix L) First, we need to look up the reduction half reactions (in for each oxide in the specified oxidation state: 6e−⟶2Cr3+ 2−+ 14H+ Cr2 O7 + + 7H2 O +1.33 V 5e−⟶Mn2+ −+ 8H+ MnO4 + + H2 O +1.51 V 2e−⟶Ti2+ 4H+ TiO2 + + + 2H2 O −0.50 V A larger reduction potential means that it is easier to reduce the reactant.

Dichromate is next, followed by titanium dioxide as the weakest oxidizing agent (the hardest to reduce) of this set.

The time periods in human history known as the Bronze Age and Iron Age mark the advancements in which societies learned to isolate certain metals and use them to make tools and goods. Naturally occurring ores of copper, silver, and gold can contain high concentrations of these (Figure 19.5). metals in elemental form Iron, on the other hand, occurs on earth almost exclusively in oxidized forms, such as rust (Fe2O3). The earliest known iron implements were made from iron meteorites. Surviving iron artifacts dating from approximately 4000 to 2500 BC are rare, but all known examples contain specific alloys of iron and nickel that occur only in extraterrestrial objects, not on earth. It took thousands of years of technological advances before civilizations developed iron smelting, the ability to extract a pure element from its naturally occurring ores and for iron tools to become common. https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

Examples include (a) a nugget of copper, (b) a deposit of gold, and (c) an ore containing oxidized iron. (credit a: modification of work by http://images-of- elements.com/copper-2.jpg; credit c: modification of work by http://images-of-elements.com/iron-ore.jpg) Generally, the transition elements are extracted from minerals found in a variety of ores. However, the ease of their recovery varies widely, depending on the concentration of the element in the ore, the identity of the other elements present, and the difficulty of reducing the element to the free metal. In general, it is not difficult to reduce ions of the d-block elements to the free element. Carbon is a sufficiently strong reducing agent in most cases. However, like the ions of the more active main group metals, ions of the f-block elements must be isolated by electrolysis or by reduction with an active metal such as calcium. We shall discuss the processes used for the isolation of iron, copper, and silver because these three processes illustrate the principal means of isolating most of the d-block metals. In general, each of these processes involves three principal steps: preliminary treatment, smelting, and refining. Preliminary treatment. In general, there is an initial treatment of the ores to make them suitable for the 1. extraction of the metals. This usually involves crushing or grinding the ore, concentrating the metal-bearing components, and sometimes treating these substances chemically to convert them into compounds that are easier to reduce to the metal. Smelting. The next step is the extraction of the metal in the molten state, a process called smelting, which 2. includes reduction of the metallic compound to the metal. Impurities may be removed by the addition of a compound that forms a slag—a substance with a low melting point that can be readily separated from the molten metal. Refining. The final step in the recovery of a metal is refining the metal. Low boiling metals such as zinc and 3. mercury can be refined by distillation. When fused on an inclined table, low melting metals like tin flow away from higher-melting impurities. Electrolysis is another common method for refining metals. Isolation of Iron The early application of iron to the manufacture of tools and weapons was possible because of the wide distribution of iron ores and the ease with which iron compounds in the ores could be reduced by carbon. For a long time, charcoal was the form of carbon used in the reduction process. The production and use of iron became much more widespread about 1620, when coke was introduced as the reducing agent. Coke is a form of carbon formed by heating coal in the absence of air to remove impurities. The first step in the metallurgy of iron is usually roasting the ore (heating the ore in air) to remove water, decomposing carbonates into oxides, and converting sulfides into oxides. The oxides are then reduced in a blast furnace that is (Figure 19.6) 80–100 feet high and about 25 feet in diameter in which the roasted ore, coke, and limestone (impure 

--- Page 1092 ---
1084 Chapter 19 | Transition Metals and Coordination Chemistry CaCO3) are introduced continuously into the top. Molten iron and slag are withdrawn at the bottom. The entire stock in a furnace may weigh several hundred tons. Figure 19.6 Within a blast furnace, different reactions occur in different temperature zones. Carbon monoxide is generated in the hotter bottom regions and rises upward to reduce the iron oxides to pure iron through a series of reactions that take place in the upper regions. Near the bottom of a furnace are nozzles through which preheated air is blown into the furnace. As soon as the air enters, the coke in the region of the nozzles is oxidized to carbon dioxide with the liberation of a great deal of heat. The hot carbon dioxide passes upward through the overlying layer of white-hot coke, where it is reduced to carbon monoxide: CO2(g) + C(s) ⟶2CO(g) The carbon monoxide serves as the reducing agent in the upper regions of the furnace. The individual reactions are Figure 19.6. indicated in The iron oxides are reduced in the upper region of the furnace. In the middle region, limestone (calcium carbonate) decomposes, and the resulting calcium oxide combines with silica and silicates in the ore to form slag. The slag is mostly calcium silicate and contains most of the commercially unimportant components of the ore: CaO(s) + SiO2(s) ⟶CaSiO3(l) Just below the middle of the furnace, the temperature is high enough to melt both the iron and the slag. They collect in layers at the bottom of the furnace; the less dense slag floats on the iron and protects it from oxidation.

The iron is transferred to casting machines or (Figure 19.7). to a steelmaking plant Figure 19.7 Molten iron is shown being cast as steel. (credit: Clint Budd) Much of the iron produced is refined and converted into steel. Steel is made from iron by removing impurities and adding substances such as manganese, chromium, nickel, tungsten, molybdenum, and vanadium to produce alloys with properties that make the material suitable for specific uses. Most steels also contain small but definite percentages of carbon (0.04%–2.5%). However, a large part of the carbon contained in iron must be removed in the manufacture of steel; otherwise, the excess carbon would make the iron brittle. Link to Learning You can watch an animation of steelmaking (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/ 16steelmaking) that walks you through the process. Isolation of Copper The most important ores of copper contain copper sulfides (such as covellite, CuS), although copper oxides (such as tenorite, CuO) and copper hydroxycarbonates [such as malachite, Cu2(OH)2CO3] are sometimes found. In the production of copper metal, the concentrated sulfide ore is roasted to remove part of the sulfur as sulfur dioxide. The remaining mixture, which consists of Cu2S, FeS, FeO, and SiO2, is mixed with limestone, which serves as a flux (a material that aids in the removal of impurities), and heated. Molten slag forms as the iron and silica are removed by Lewis acid-base reactions: CaCO3(s) + SiO2(s) ⟶CaSiO3(l) + CO2(g) FeO(s) + SiO2(s) ⟶FeSiO3(l) 

--- Page 1094 ---
1086 Chapter 19 | Transition Metals and Coordination Chemistry In these reactions, the silicon dioxide behaves as a Lewis acid, which accepts a pair of electrons from the Lewis base (the oxide ion). Reduction of the Cu2S that remains after smelting is accomplished by blowing air through the molten material. The air converts part of the Cu2S into Cu2O. As soon as copper(I) oxide is formed, it is reduced by the remaining copper(I) sulfide to metallic copper: 2SO2(g) 2Cu2 S(l) + 3O2(g) ⟶2Cu2 O(l) + ⟶6Cu(l) + SO2(g) 2Cu2 O(l) + Cu2 S(l) The copper obtained in this way is called blister copper because of its characteristic appearance, which is due to the (Figure 19.8). air blisters it contains This impure copper is cast into large plates, which are used as anodes in the electrolytic refining of the metal (which is described in the chapter on electrochemistry). Figure 19.8 Blister copper is obtained during the conversion of copper-containing ore into pure copper. (credit: “Tortie tude”/Wikimedia Commons) Isolation of Silver (Figure 19.9) Silver sometimes occurs in large nuggets but more frequently in veins and related deposits. At one time, panning was an effective method of isolating both silver and gold nuggets. Due to their low reactivity, these metals, and a few others, occur in deposits as nuggets. The discovery of platinum was due to Spanish explorers in Central America mistaking platinum nuggets for silver. When the metal is not in the form of nuggets, it often useful to employ a process called hydrometallurgy to separate silver from its ores. Hydrology involves the separation of a metal from a mixture by first converting it into soluble ions and then extracting and reducing them to precipitate the pure metal.

Oxygen is a good oxidizing agent for these reactions because it can gain electrons to go from the 0 oxidation state to the 2− state. Check Your Learning During the refining of iron, carbon must be present in the blast furnace. Why is carbon necessary to convert iron oxide into iron? Answer: The carbon is converted into CO, which is the reducing agent that accepts electrons so that iron(III) can be reduced to iron(0). Transition Metal Compounds The bonding in the simple compounds of the transition elements ranges from ionic to covalent. In their lower oxidation states, the transition elements form ionic compounds; in their higher oxidation states, they form covalent compounds or polyatomic ions. The variation in oxidation states exhibited by the transition elements gives these compounds a metal-based, oxidation-reduction chemistry. The chemistry of several classes of compounds containing elements of the transition series follows.

1088 Chapter 19 | Transition Metals and Coordination Chemistry Halides Anhydrous halides of each of the transition elements can be prepared by the direct reaction of the metal with halogens. For example: 3Cl2(g) ⟶2FeCl3(s) 2Fe(s) + Heating a metal halide with additional metal can be used to form a halide of the metal with a lower oxidation state: Fe(s) + 2FeCl3(s) ⟶3FeCl2(s) The stoichiometry of the metal halide that results from the reaction of the metal with a halogen is determined by the relative amounts of metal and halogen and by the strength of the halogen as an oxidizing agent. Generally, fluorine forms fluoride-containing metals in their highest oxidation states. The other halogens may not form analogous compounds. In general, the preparation of stable water solutions of the halides of the metals of the first transition series is by the addition of a hydrohalic acid to carbonates, hydroxides, oxides, or other compounds that contain basic anions. Sample reactions are: NiCO3(s) + 2HF(aq) ⟶NiF2(aq) + H2 O(l) + CO2(g) Co(OH)2(s) 2HBr(aq) ⟶CoBr2(aq) 2H2 O(l) + + Most of the first transition series metals also dissolve in acids, forming a solution of the salt and hydrogen gas. For example: Cr(s) + 2HCl(aq) ⟶CrCl2(aq) + H2(g) The polarity of bonds with transition metals varies based not only upon the electronegativities of the atoms involved but also upon the oxidation state of the transition metal. Remember that bond polarity is a continuous spectrum with electrons being shared evenly (covalent bonds) at one extreme and electrons being transferred completely (ionic bonds) at the other. No bond is ever 100% ionic, and the degree to which the electrons are evenly distributed determines many properties of the compound. Transition metal halides with low oxidation numbers form more ionic bonds. For example, titanium(II) chloride and titanium(III) chloride (TiCl2 and TiCl3) have high melting points that are characteristic of ionic compounds, but titanium(IV) chloride (TiCl4) is a volatile liquid, consistent with having covalent titanium-chlorine bonds. All halides of the heavier d-block elements have significant covalent characteristics. The covalent behavior of the transition metals with higher oxidation states is exemplified by the reaction of the metal tetrahalides with water. Like covalent silicon tetrachloride, both the titanium and vanadium tetrahalides react with water to give solutions containing the corresponding hydrohalic acids and the metal oxides: ⟶SiO2(s) + 4HCl(aq) SiCl4(l) + 2H2 O(l) ⟶TiO2(s) + 4HCl(aq) TiCl4(l) + 2H2 O(l) Oxides As with the halides, the nature of bonding in oxides of the transition elements is determined by the oxidation state of the metal. Oxides with low oxidation states tend to be more ionic, whereas those with higher oxidation states are more covalent. These variations in bonding are because the electronegativities of the elements are not fixed values. The electronegativity of an element increases with increasing oxidation state. Transition metals in low oxidation states have lower electronegativity values than oxygen; therefore, these metal oxides are ionic. Transition metals in very high oxidation states have electronegativity values close to that of oxygen, which leads to these oxides being covalent. The oxides of the first transition series can be prepared by heating the metals in air. These oxides are Sc2O3, TiO2, V2O5, Cr2O3, Mn3O4, Fe3O4, Co3O4, NiO, and CuO. https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

Chapter 19 | Transition Metals and Coordination Chemistry 1089 Alternatively, these oxides and other oxides (with the metals in different oxidation states) can be produced by heating the corresponding hydroxides, carbonates, or oxalates in an inert atmosphere. Iron(II) oxide can be prepared by heating iron(II) oxalate, and cobalt(II) oxide is produced by heating cobalt(II) hydroxide: FeC2 O4(s) ⟶FeO(s) + CO(g) + CO2(g) Co(OH)2(s) ⟶CoO(s) + H2 O(g) With the exception of CrO3 and Mn2O7, transition metal oxides are not soluble in water. They can react with acids and, in a few cases, with bases. Overall, oxides of transition metals with the lowest oxidation states are basic (and react with acids), the intermediate ones are amphoteric, and the highest oxidation states are primarily acidic. Basic metal oxides at a low oxidation state react with aqueous acids to form solutions of salts and water. Examples include the reaction of cobalt(II) oxide accepting protons from nitric acid, and scandium(III) oxide accepting protons from hydrochloric acid: + H2 O(l) CoO(s) + 2HNO3(aq) ⟶Co(NO3)2(aq) + 3H2 O(l) Sc2 O3(s) + 6HCl(aq) ⟶2ScCl3(aq) The oxides of metals with oxidation states of 4+ are amphoteric, and most are not soluble in either acids or bases. Vanadium(V) oxide, chromium(VI) oxide, and manganese(VII) oxide are acidic. They react with solutions 3−, 2−, −. VO4 CrO4 MnO4 of hydroxides to form salts of the oxyanions and For example, the complete ionic equation for the reaction of chromium(VI) oxide with a strong base is given by: 2Na+(aq) 2OH−(aq) ⟶2Na+(aq) 2−(aq) CrO3(s) + + + CrO4 + H2 O(l) Chromium(VI) oxide and manganese(VII) oxide react with water to form the acids H2CrO4 and HMnO4, respectively. Hydroxides When a soluble hydroxide is added to an aqueous solution of a salt of a transition metal of the first transition series, a gelatinous precipitate forms. For example, adding a solution of sodium hydroxide to a solution of cobalt sulfate produces a gelatinous pink or blue precipitate of cobalt(II) hydroxide. The net ionic equation is: Co2+(aq) 2OH−(aq) + ⟶Co(OH)2(s) In this and many other cases, these precipitates are hydroxides containing the transition metal ion, hydroxide ions, and water coordinated to the transition metal. In other cases, the precipitates are hydrated oxides composed of the metal ion, oxide ions, and water of hydration: 4Fe3+(aq) 6OH−(aq) + + n H2 O(l) ⟶2Fe2 O3 ·(n + 3)H2 O(s) These substances do not contain hydroxide ions. However, both the hydroxides and the hydrated oxides react with acids to form salts and water. When precipitating a metal from solution, it is necessary to avoid an excess of hydroxide ion, as this may lead to complex ion formation as discussed later in this chapter. The precipitated metal hydroxides can be separated for further processing or for waste disposal. Carbonates Many of the elements of the first transition series form insoluble carbonates. It is possible to prepare these carbonates by the addition of a soluble carbonate salt to a solution of a transition metal salt. For example, nickel carbonate can be prepared from solutions of nickel nitrate and sodium carbonate according to the following net ionic equation: Ni2+(aq) 2−⟶NiCO3(s) + CO3 The reactions of the transition metal carbonates are similar to those of the active metal carbonates. They react with acids to form metals salts, carbon dioxide, and water. Upon heating, they decompose, forming the transition metal oxides.

1090 Chapter 19 | Transition Metals and Coordination Chemistry Other Salts In many respects, the chemical behavior of the elements of the first transition series is very similar to that of the main group metals. In particular, the same types of reactions that are used to prepare salts of the main group metals can be used to prepare simple ionic salts of these elements. A variety of salts can be prepared from metals that are more active than hydrogen by reaction with the corresponding acids: Scandium metal reacts with hydrobromic acid to form a solution of scandium bromide: 6HBr(aq) ⟶2ScBr3(aq) + 3H2(g) 2Sc(s) + The common compounds that we have just discussed can also be used to prepare salts. The reactions involved include the reactions of oxides, hydroxides, or carbonates with acids. For example: ⟶Ni2+(aq) O+(aq) −(aq) −(aq) Ni(OH)2(s) + 2H3 + 2ClO4 + 2ClO4 + 4H2 O(l) Substitution reactions involving soluble salts may be used to prepare insoluble salts. For example: Ba2+(aq) 2Cl−(aq) 2K+(aq) 2Cl−(aq) 2K+(aq) 2−(aq) + ⟶BaCrO4(s) + + + + CrO4 In our discussion of oxides in this section, we have seen that reactions of the covalent oxides of the transition elements with hydroxides form salts that contain oxyanions of the transition elements. How Sciences Interconnect High Temperature Superconductors A superconductor is a substance that conducts electricity with no resistance. This lack of resistance means that there is no energy loss during the transmission of electricity. This would lead to a significant reduction in the cost of electricity. Most currently used, commercial superconducting materials, such as NbTi and Nb3Sn, do not become superconducting until they are cooled below 23 K (−250 °C). This requires the use of liquid helium, which has a boiling temperature of 4 K and is expensive and difficult to handle. The cost of liquid helium has deterred the widespread application of superconductors. One of the most exciting scientific discoveries of the 1980s was the characterization of compounds that exhibit superconductivity at temperatures above 90 K. (Compared to liquid helium, 90 K is a high temperature.) Typical among the high-temperature superconducting materials are oxides containing yttrium (or one of several rare earth elements), barium, and copper in a 1:2:3 ratio. The formula of the ionic yttrium compound is YBa2Cu3O7. The new materials become superconducting at temperatures close to 90 K (Figure 19.10), temperatures that can be reached by cooling with liquid nitrogen (boiling temperature of 77 K). Not only are liquid nitrogen-cooled materials easier to handle, but the cooling costs are also about 1000 times lower than for liquid helium. https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

Chapter 19 | Transition Metals and Coordination Chemistry 1091 Figure 19.10 The resistance of the high-temperature superconductor YBa2Cu3O7 varies with temperature. Note how the resistance falls to zero below 92 K, when the substance becomes superconducting. Although the brittle, fragile nature of these materials presently hampers their commercial applications, they have tremendous potential that researchers are hard at work improving their processes to help realize. Superconducting transmission lines would carry current for hundreds of miles with no loss of power due to resistance in the wires. This could allow generating stations to be located in areas remote from population centers and near the natural resources necessary for power production. The first project demonstrating the viability of high-temperature superconductor power transmission was established in New York in 2008. Researchers are also working on using this technology to develop other applications, such as smaller and more powerful microchips. In addition, high-temperature superconductors can be used to generate magnetic fields for applications such as medical devices, magnetic levitation trains, and containment fields for nuclear fusion reactors (Figure 19.11). Figure 19.11 (a) This magnetic levitation train (or maglev) uses superconductor technology to move along its tracks. (b) A magnet can be levitated using a dish like this as a superconductor.

Ions of the metals, especially the transition metals, are likely to (Figure 19.12). form complexes. Many of these compounds are highly colored In the remainder of this chapter, we will consider the structure and bonding of these remarkable compounds. Figure 19.12 Metal ions that contain partially filled d subshell usually form colored complex ions; ions with empty d (d0) (d10) subshell or with filled d subshells usually form colorless complexes.

For instance, the four valence electrons of carbon overlap with electrons from four hydrogen atoms to form CH4. The one valence electron leaves sodium and adds to the seven valence (Figure 19.13). electrons of chlorine to form the ionic formula unit NaCl Transition metals do not normally bond in this fashion. They primarily form coordinate covalent bonds, a form of the Lewis acid-base interaction in which both of the electrons in the bond are contributed by a donor (Lewis base) to an electron acceptor (Lewis acid). The Lewis acid in coordination complexes, often called a central metal ion (or atom), is often a transition metal or inner transition metal, although main group elements can also form coordination compounds.

Chapter 19 | Transition Metals and Coordination Chemistry 1093 called ligands, can be a wide variety of chemicals—atoms, molecules, or ions. The only requirement is that they have one or more electron pairs, which can be donated to the central metal. Most often, this involves a donor atom with a lone pair of electrons that can form a coordinate bond to the metal. Figure 19.13 (a) Covalent bonds involve the sharing of electrons, and ionic bonds involve the transferring of electrons associated with each bonding atom, as indicated by the colored electrons. (b) However, coordinate covalent bonds involve electrons from a Lewis base being donated to a metal center. The lone pairs from six water molecules form bonds to the scandium ion to form an octahedral complex. (Only the donated pairs are shown.) The coordination sphere consists of the central metal ion or atom plus its attached ligands. Brackets in a formula enclose the coordination sphere; species outside the brackets are not part of the coordination sphere. The coordination number of the central metal ion or atom is the number of donor atoms bonded to it. The coordination [Ag(NH3)2]+ [CuCl4]2−, (Figure 19.14). number for the silver ion in is two For the copper(II) ion in the coordination [Co(H2O)6]2+ number is four, whereas for the cobalt(II) ion in the coordination number is six. Each of these ligands is monodentate, from the Greek for “one toothed,” meaning that they connect with the central metal through only one atom. In this case, the number of ligands and the coordination number are equal. [Ag(NH3)2]+, [Cu(Cl)4]2−, [Co(H2O)6]2+ Figure 19.14 The complexes (a) (b) and (c) have coordination numbers of two, four, and six, respectively. The geometries of these complexes are the same as we have seen with VSEPR theory for main group elements: linear, tetrahedral, and octahedral. Many other ligands coordinate to the metal in more complex fashions. Bidentate ligands are those in which two atoms coordinate to the metal center. For example, ethylenediamine (en, H2NCH2CH2NH2) contains two nitrogen (Figure 19.15). atoms, each of which has a lone pair and can serve as a Lewis base Both of the atoms can coordinate [Co(en)3]3+, to a single metal center. In the complex there are three bidentate en ligands, and the coordination number of the cobalt(III) ion is six. The most common coordination numbers are two, four, and six, but examples of all coordination numbers from 1 to 15 are known.

1094 Chapter 19 | Transition Metals and Coordination Chemistry Figure 19.15 (a) The ethylenediamine (en) ligand contains two atoms with lone pairs that can coordinate to the ⎡ ⎤ ⎦3+ ⎣Co(en)3 metal center. (b) The cobalt(III) complex contains three of these ligands, each forming two bonds to the cobalt ion. Any ligand that bonds to a central metal ion by more than one donor atom is a polydentate ligand (or “many teeth”) because it can bite into the metal center with more than one bond. The term chelate (pronounced “KEY-late”) from the Greek for “claw” is also used to describe this type of interaction. Many polydentate ligands are chelating ligands, and a complex consisting of one or more of these ligands and a central metal is a chelate. A chelating ligand is also known as a chelating agent. A chelating ligand holds the metal ion rather like a crab’s claw would hold a marble. Figure 19.15 showed one example of a chelate. The heme complex in hemoglobin is another important example (Figure 19.16). It contains a polydentate ligand with four donor atoms that coordinate to iron. Figure 19.16 The single ligand heme contains four nitrogen atoms that coordinate to iron in hemoglobin to form a chelate. Polydentate ligands are sometimes identified with prefixes that indicate the number of donor atoms in the ligand. Cl−, As we have seen, ligands with one donor atom, such as NH3, and H2O, are monodentate ligands. Ligands with two donor groups are bidentate ligands. Ethylenediamine, H2NCH2CH2NH2, and the anion of the acid glycine, −(Figure NH2 CH2 CO2 19.17) are examples of bidentate ligands. Tridentate ligands, tetradentate ligands, pentadentate ligands, and hexadentate ligands contain three, four, five, and six donor atoms, respectively. The ligand (Figure 19.16) in heme is a tetradentate ligand. https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

Chapter 19 | Transition Metals and Coordination Chemistry 1095 Figure 19.17 Each of the anionic ligands shown attaches in a bidentate fashion to platinum(II), with both a nitrogen and oxygen atom coordinating to the metal. The Naming of Complexes The nomenclature of the complexes is patterned after a system suggested by Alfred Werner, a Swiss chemist and Nobel laureate, whose outstanding work more than 100 years ago laid the foundation for a clearer understanding of these compounds. The following five rules are used for naming complexes: If a coordination compound is ionic, name the cation first and the anion second, in accordance with the usual 1. nomenclature. Name the ligands first, followed by the central metal. Name the ligands alphabetically. Negative ligands 2. Table 19.1. (anions) have names formed by adding -o to the stem name of the group. For examples, see For most neutral ligands, the name of the molecule is used. The four common exceptions are aqua (H2O), amine (NH3), carbonyl (CO), and nitrosyl (NO). For example, name [Pt(NH3)2Cl4] as diaminetetrachloroplatinum(IV). Examples of Anionic Ligands Anionic Ligand Name fluoro F− chloro Cl− bromo Br− iodo I− cyano CN− − NO3 nitrato hydroxo OH− oxo O2– 2− C2 O4 oxalato 2− CO2 carbonato Table 19.1 If more than one ligand of a given type is present, the number is indicated by the prefixes di- (for two), tri- 3. (for three), tetra- (for four), penta- (for five), and hexa- (for six). Sometimes, the prefixes bis- (for two), tris- (for three), and tetrakis- (for four) are used when the name of the ligand already includes di-, tri-, or tetra-, or 

--- Page 1104 ---
1096 Chapter 19 | Transition Metals and Coordination Chemistry when the ligand name begins with a vowel. For example, the ion bis(bipyridyl)osmium(II) uses bis- to signify that there are two ligands attached to Os, and each bipyridyl ligand contains two pyridine groups (C5H4N). When the complex is either a cation or a neutral molecule, the name of the central metal atom is spelled exactly like (Table the name of the element and is followed by a Roman numeral in parentheses to indicate its oxidation state 19.2 Table 19.3). and When the complex is an anion, the suffix -ate is added to the stem of the name of the metal, (Table 19.4). followed by the Roman numeral designation of its oxidation state Sometimes, the Latin name of the metal is used when the English name is clumsy. For example, ferrate is used instead of ironate, plumbate instead leadate, and stannate instead of tinate. The oxidation state of the metal is determined based on the charges of each ligand and the overall charge of the coordination compound. For example, in [Cr(H2O)4Cl2]Br, the coordination sphere (in brackets) has a charge of 1+ to balance the bromide ion. The water ligands are neutral, and the chloride ligands are anionic with a charge of 1−each. To determine the oxidation state of the metal, we set the overall charge equal to the sum of the ligands and the metal: +1 = −2 + x, so the oxidation state (x) is equal to 3+.

Chapter 19 | Transition Metals and Coordination Chemistry 1099 Figure 19.19 Many transition metal complexes adopt octahedral geometries, with six donor atoms forming bond angles of 90° about the central atom with adjacent ligands. Note that only ligands within the coordination sphere affect the geometry around the metal center. For transition metals with a coordination number of four, two different geometries are possible: tetrahedral or square planar. Unlike main group elements, where these geometries can be predicted from VSEPR theory, a more detailed discussion of transition metal orbitals (discussed in the section on Crystal Field Theory) is required to predict which [Zn(CN)4]2−(Figure complexes will be tetrahedral and which will be square planar. In tetrahedral complexes such as 19.20), each of the ligand pairs forms an angle of 109.5°. In square planar complexes, such as [Pt(NH3)2Cl2], each ligand has two other ligands at 90° angles (called the cis positions) and one additional ligand at an 180° angle, in the trans position. Figure 19.20 Transition metals with a coordination number of four can adopt a tetrahedral geometry (a) as in K2[Zn(CN)4] or a square planar geometry (b) as shown in [Pt(NH3)2Cl2]. Isomerism in Complexes Isomers are different chemical species that have the same chemical formula. Transition metals often form geometric isomers, in which the same atoms are connected through the same types of bonds but with differences in their orientation in space. Coordination complexes with two different ligands in the cis and trans positions from a ligand [Co(NH3)4Cl2]+ of interest form isomers. For example, the octahedral ion has two isomers. In the cis configuration, (Figure 19.21). the two chloride ligands are adjacent to each other The other isomer, the trans configuration, has the two chloride ligands directly across from one another.

1100 Chapter 19 | Transition Metals and Coordination Chemistry [Co(H2O)4Cl2]+ Figure 19.21 The cis and trans isomers of contain the same ligands attached to the same metal ion, but the spatial arrangement causes these two compounds to have very different properties. Different geometric isomers of a substance are different chemical compounds. They exhibit different properties, even though they have the same formula. For example, the two isomers of [Co(NH3)4Cl2]NO3 differ in color; the cis form is violet, and the trans form is green. Furthermore, these isomers have different dipole moments, solubilities, and reactivities. As an example of how the arrangement in space can influence the molecular properties, consider the polarity of the two [Co(NH3)4Cl2]NO3 isomers. Remember that the polarity of a molecule or ion is determined by the bond dipoles (which are due to the difference in electronegativity of the bonding atoms) and their arrangement in space. In one isomer, cis chloride ligands cause more electron density on one side of the molecule than on the other, making it polar. For the trans isomer, each ligand is directly across from an identical ligand, so the bond dipoles cancel out, and the molecule is nonpolar. Example 19.5 Geometric Isomers Figure 19.20.

Chapter 19 | Transition Metals and Coordination Chemistry 1101 mirror images. A classic example of this is a pair of hands, in which the right and left hand are mirror images of one another but cannot be superimposed. Optical isomers are very important in organic and biochemistry because living systems often incorporate one specific optical isomer and not the other. Unlike geometric isomers, pairs of optical isomers have identical properties (boiling point, polarity, solubility, etc.). Optical isomers differ only in the way they affect polarized light and how they react with other optical isomers. For coordination complexes, many coordination [M(en)3]n+ Mn+ compounds such as [in which is a central metal ion such as iron(III) or cobalt(II)] form enantiomers, Figure 19.23. as shown in These two isomers will react differently with other optical isomers. For example, DNA helices are optical isomers, and the form that occurs in nature (right-handed DNA) will bind to only one isomer of [M(en)3]n+ and not the other. [M(en)3]n+ (Mn+ Figure 19.23 The complex = a metal ion, en = ethylenediamine) has a nonsuperimposable mirror image. [Co(en)2Cl2]+ The ion exhibits geometric isomerism (cis/trans), and its cis isomer exists as a pair of optical isomers (Figure 19.24). [Co(en)2Cl2]+ Figure 19.24 Three isomeric forms of exist. The trans isomer, formed when the chlorines are positioned at a 180° angle, has very different properties from the cis isomers. The mirror images of the cis isomer form a pair of optical isomers, which have identical behavior except when reacting with other enantiomers. Linkage isomers occur when the coordination compound contains a ligand that can bind to the transition metal center through two different atoms. For example, the CN ligand can bind through the carbon atom (cyano) or through the nitrogen atom (isocyano). Similarly, SCN−can be bound through the sulfur or nitrogen atom, affording two distinct ([Co(NH3)5SCN]2+ [Co(NH3)5NCS]2+). compounds or Ionization isomers (or coordination isomers) occur when one anionic ligand in the inner coordination sphere is replaced with the counter ion from the outer coordination sphere. A simple example of two ionization isomers are [CoCl6][Br] and [CoCl5Br][Cl].

Chlorophyll, the green pigment in plants, is a complex that contains magnesium This is an example of a main group element in a coordination complex. Plants appear green because chlorophyll absorbs red and purple light; the reflected light consequently appears green. The energy resulting from the absorption of light is used in photosynthesis. Figure 19.25 (a) Chlorophyll comes in several different forms, which all have the same basic structure around the magnesium center. (b) Copper phthalocyanine blue, a square planar copper complex, is present in some blue dyes. Chemistry in Everyday Life Transition Metal Catalysts One of the most important applications of transition metals is as industrial catalysts. As you recall from the chapter on kinetics, a catalyst increases the rate of reaction by lowering the activation energy and is regenerated in the catalytic cycle. Over 90% of all manufactured products are made with the aid of one or more catalysts. The ability to bind ligands and change oxidation states makes transition metal catalysts well suited for catalytic applications. Vanadium oxide is used to produce 230,000,000 tons of sulfuric acid worldwide each year, which in turn is used to make everything from fertilizers to cans for food. Plastics are made with the aid of transition metal catalysts, along with detergents, fertilizers, paints, and more (see Figure 19.26). Very complicated pharmaceuticals are manufactured with catalysts that are selective, reacting with one specific bond out of a large number of possibilities. Catalysts allow processes to be more economical and more environmentally friendly. Developing new catalysts and better understanding of existing systems are important areas of current research. https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

This has many potential useful applications, from powering cars with hydrogen fuel cells to making better electronics components. Although not a complex, self-darkening sunglasses are an example of a photoactive substance.

Many other coordination complexes are also brightly colored. The square planar copper(II) complex phthalocyanine Figure 19.25) blue (from is one of many complexes used as pigments or dyes. This complex is used in blue ink, blue jeans, and certain blue paints. (Figure 19.29), The structure of heme the iron-containing complex in hemoglobin, is very similar to that in chlorophyll. In hemoglobin, the red heme complex is bonded to a large protein molecule (globin) by the attachment of the protein to the heme ligand. Oxygen molecules are transported by hemoglobin in the blood by being bound to the iron center. When the hemoglobin loses its oxygen, the color changes to a bluish red.

Each subunit is shown in a different color. Ca2+, Mg2+, Fe2+, Complexing agents often are used for water softening because they tie up such ions as and which make water hard. Many metal ions are also undesirable in food products because these ions can catalyze reactions that change the color of food. Coordination complexes are useful as preservatives. For example, the ligand EDTA, (HO2CCH2)2NCH2CH2N(CH2CO2H)2, coordinates to metal ions through six donor atoms and prevents the metals (Figure 19.30). from reacting This ligand also is used to sequester metal ions in paper production, textiles, and detergents, and has pharmaceutical uses. Figure 19.30 The ligand EDTA binds tightly to a variety of metal ions by forming hexadentate complexes.

1106 Chapter 19 | Transition Metals and Coordination Chemistry Complexing agents that tie up metal ions are also used as drugs. British Anti-Lewisite (BAL), HSCH2CH(SH)CH2OH, is a drug developed during World War I as an antidote for the arsenic-based war gas Lewisite. BAL is now used to treat poisoning by heavy metals, such as arsenic, mercury, thallium, and chromium. The drug is a ligand and functions by making a water-soluble chelate of the metal; the kidneys eliminate this metal chelate (Figure 19.31). Another polydentate ligand, enterobactin, which is isolated from certain bacteria, is used to form complexes of iron and thereby to control the severe iron buildup found in patients suffering from blood diseases such as Cooley’s anemia, who require frequent transfusions. As the transfused blood breaks down, the usual metabolic processes that remove iron are overloaded, and excess iron can build up to fatal levels. Enterobactin forms a water- soluble complex with excess iron, and the body can safely eliminate this complex. Figure 19.31 Coordination complexes are used as drugs. (a) British Anti-Lewisite is used to treat heavy metal poisoning by coordinating metals (M), and enterobactin (b) allows excess iron in the blood to be removed. Example 19.6 Chelation Therapy Ligands like BAL and enterobactin are important in medical treatments for heavy metal poisoning. However, chelation therapies can disrupt the normal concentration of ions in the body, leading to serious side effects, so researchers are searching for new chelation drugs. One drug that has been developed is Figure 19.32. dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA), shown in Identify which atoms in this molecule could act as donor atoms.

Chapter 19 | Transition Metals and Coordination Chemistry 1107 All of the oxygen and sulfur atoms have lone pairs of electrons that can be used to coordinate to a metal center, so there are six possible donor atoms. Geometrically, only two of these atoms can be coordinated to a metal at once. The most common binding mode involves the coordination of one sulfur atom and one oxygen atom, forming a five-member ring with the metal. Check Your Learning Some alternative medicine practitioners recommend chelation treatments for ailments that are not clearly related to heavy metals, such as cancer and autism, although the practice is discouraged by many scientific organizations.[1] Identify at least two biologically important metals that could be disrupted by chelation therapy. Answer: Ca, Fe, Zn, and Cu Ligands are also used in the electroplating industry. When metal ions are reduced to produce thin metal coatings, metals can clump together to form clusters and nanoparticles. When metal coordination complexes are used, the ligands keep the metal atoms isolated from each other. It has been found that many metals plate out as a smoother, more uniform, better-looking, and more adherent surface when plated from a bath containing the metal as a complex [Ag(CN)2]−and [Au(CN)2]−are ion. Thus, complexes such as used extensively in the electroplating industry. In 1965, scientists at Michigan State University discovered that there was a platinum complex that inhibited cell division in certain microorganisms. Later work showed that the complex was cis-diaminedichloroplatinum(II), [Pt(NH3)2(Cl)2], and that the trans isomer was not effective. The inhibition of cell division indicated that this square planar compound could be an anticancer agent. In 1978, the US Food and Drug Administration approved this compound, known as cisplatin, for use in the treatment of certain forms of cancer. Since that time, many similar platinum compounds have been developed for the treatment of cancer. In all cases, these are the cis isomers and never the trans isomers. The diamine (NH3)2 portion is retained with other groups, replacing the dichloro [(Cl)2] portion. The newer drugs include carboplatin, oxaliplatin, and satraplatin. 19.3 Spectroscopic and Magnetic Properties of Coordination Compounds By the end of this section, you will be able to: Outline the basic premise of crystal field theory (CFT) • Identify molecular geometries associated with various d-orbital splitting patterns • Predict electron configurations of split d orbitals for selected transition metal atoms or ions • Explain spectral and magnetic properties in terms of CFT concepts • The behavior of coordination compounds cannot be adequately explained by the same theories used for main group element chemistry. The observed geometries of coordination complexes are not consistent with hybridized orbitals on the central metal overlapping with ligand orbitals, as would be predicted by valence bond theory. The observed colors indicate that the d orbitals often occur at different energy levels rather than all being degenerate, that is, of equal energy, as are the three p orbitals. To explain the stabilities, structures, colors, and magnetic properties of transition metal complexes, a different bonding model has been developed. Just as valence bond theory explains many aspects of bonding in main group chemistry, crystal field theory is useful in understanding and predicting the behavior of transition metal complexes. 1.

1108 Chapter 19 | Transition Metals and Coordination Chemistry Crystal Field Theory To explain the observed behavior of transition metal complexes (such as how colors arise), a model involving electrostatic interactions between the electrons from the ligands and the electrons in the unhybridized d orbitals of the central metal atom has been developed. This electrostatic model is crystal field theory (CFT). It allows us to understand, interpret, and predict the colors, magnetic behavior, and some structures of coordination compounds of transition metals. CFT focuses on the nonbonding electrons on the central metal ion in coordination complexes not on the metal-ligand bonds. Like valence bond theory, CFT tells only part of the story of the behavior of complexes. However, it tells the part that valence bond theory does not. In its pure form, CFT ignores any covalent bonding between ligands and metal ions. Both the ligand and the metal are treated as infinitesimally small point charges. All electrons are negative, so the electrons donated from the ligands will repel the electrons of the central metal. Let us consider the behavior of the electrons in the unhybridized d orbitals in an octahedral complex. The five d orbitals Figure 19.33. consist of lobe-shaped regions and are arranged in space, as shown in In an octahedral complex, the six ligands coordinate along the axes. Figure 19.33 The directional characteristics of the five d orbitals are shown here. The shaded portions indicate the phase of the orbitals. The ligands (L) coordinate along the axes. For clarity, the ligands have been omitted from the dx2−y2 orbital so that the axis labels could be shown. In an uncomplexed metal ion in the gas phase, the electrons are distributed among the five d orbitals in accord with Hund's rule because the orbitals all have the same energy. However, when ligands coordinate to a metal ion, the energies of the d orbitals are no longer the same. dz2 dx2 In octahedral complexes, the lobes in two of the five d orbitals, the and orbitals, point toward the ligands −y2 (Figure 19.33). These two orbitals are called the eg orbitals (the symbol actually refers to the symmetry of the orbitals, but we will use it as a convenient name for these two orbitals in an octahedral complex). The other three orbitals, the dxy, dxz, and dyz orbitals, have lobes that point between the ligands and are called the t2g orbitals (again, the symbol really refers to the symmetry of the orbitals). As six ligands approach the metal ion along the axes of the octahedron, their point charges repel the electrons in the d orbitals of the metal ion. However, the repulsions between dz2 dx2 the electrons in the eg orbitals (the and orbitals) and the ligands are greater than the repulsions between −y2 the electrons in the t2g orbitals (the dzy, dxz, and dyz orbitals) and the ligands. This is because the lobes of the eg orbitals point between them. Thus, electrons in the orbitals point directly at the ligands, whereas the lobes of the t2g eg orbitals of the metal ion in an octahedral complex have higher potential energies than those of electrons in the t2g Figure 19.34. orbitals. The difference in energy may be represented as shown in https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at 

--- Page 1117 ---
Chapter 19 | Transition Metals and Coordination Chemistry 1109 Figure 19.34 In octahedral complexes, the eg orbitals are destabilized (higher in energy) compared to the t2g orbitals because the ligands interact more strongly with the d orbitals at which they are pointed directly. The difference in energy between the eg and the t2g orbitals is called the crystal field splitting and is symbolized by Δoct, where oct stands for octahedral. The magnitude of Δoct depends on many factors, including the nature of the six ligands located around the central metal ion, the charge on the metal, and whether the metal is using 3d, 4d, or 5d orbitals. Different ligands produce different crystal field splittings. The increasing crystal field splitting produced by ligands is expressed in the spectrochemical series, a short version of which is given here: I−< Br−< Cl−< F−< 2−< −< CN− H2 O < C2 O4 NH3 < en < NO2 ⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯ → a few ligands of the spectrochemical series, in order of increasing field trength of the ligand In this series, ligands on the left cause small crystal field splittings and are weak-field ligands, whereas those on the right cause larger splittings and are strong-field ligands. Thus, the Δoct value for an octahedral complex with iodide (I−) (CN−). ligands is much smaller than the Δoct value for the same metal with cyanide ligands Electrons in the d orbitals follow the aufbau (“filling up”) principle, which says that the orbitals will be filled to give the lowest total energy, just as in main group chemistry. When two electrons occupy the same orbital, the like charges repel each other. The energy needed to pair up two electrons in a single orbital is called the pairing energy (P). Electrons will always singly occupy each orbital in a degenerate set before pairing. P is similar in magnitude to Δoct. When electrons fill the d orbitals, the relative magnitudes of Δoct and P determine which orbitals will be occupied. [Fe(CN)6]4−, In the strong field of six cyanide ligands produces a large Δoct. Under these conditions, the electrons Fe2+ require less energy to pair than they require to be excited to the eg orbitals (Δoct > P). The six 3d electrons of the (Figure 19.35). ion pair in the three t2g orbitals Complexes in which the electrons are paired because of the large crystal field splitting are called low-spin complexes because the number of unpaired electrons (spins) is minimized. 

--- Page 1118 ---
1110 Chapter 19 | Transition Metals and Coordination Chemistry Figure 19.35 Iron(II) complexes have six electrons in the 5d orbitals. In the absence of a crystal field, the orbitals [Fe(CN)6]4−, are degenerate. For coordination complexes with strong-field ligands such as Δoct is greater than P, and the electrons pair in the lower energy t2g orbitals before occupying the eg orbitals. With weak-field ligands such as H2O, the ligand field splitting is less than the pairing energy, Δoct less than P, so the electrons occupy all d orbitals singly before any pairing occurs. [Fe(H2O)6]2+, In on the other hand, the weak field of the water molecules produces only a small crystal field splitting (Δoct < P). Because it requires less energy for the electrons to occupy the eg orbitals than to pair together, there will be an electron in each of the five 3d iron(II) center in orbitals before pairing occurs. For the six d electrons on the [Fe(H2O)6]2+, (Figure 19.35). there will be one pair of electrons and four unpaired electrons Complexes such as the [Fe(H2O)6]2+ ion, in which the electrons are unpaired because the crystal field splitting is not large enough to cause them to pair, are called high-spin complexes because the number of unpaired electrons (spins) is maximized. [Fe(CN)6]3−ion A similar line of reasoning shows why the is a low-spin complex with only one unpaired electron, [Fe(H2O)6]3+ [FeF6]3−ions whereas both the and are high-spin complexes with five unpaired electrons.

Chapter 19 | Transition Metals and Coordination Chemistry 1111 Co3+ d6 (c) has valence electrons, so the crystal field splitting will determine how many are paired. Nitrite is a strong-field ligand, so the complex will be low spin. Six electrons will go in the t2g orbitals, leaving 0 unpaired. Check Your Learning The size of the crystal field splitting only influences the arrangement of electrons when there is a choice between pairing electrons and filling the higher-energy orbitals. For which d-electron configurations will there be a difference between high- and low-spin configurations in octahedral complexes? d4, d5, d6, d7 Answer: and Example 19.8 CFT for Other Geometries CFT is applicable to molecules in geometries other than octahedral. In octahedral complexes, remember that the lobes of the eg set point directly at the ligands. For tetrahedral complexes, the d orbitals remain in place, (Figure 19.36). but now we have only four ligands located between the axes None of the orbitals points directly at the tetrahedral ligands. However, the eg set (along the Cartesian axes) overlaps with the ligands less than does the t2g set. By analogy with the octahedral case, predict the energy diagram for the d orbitals in a tetrahedral crystal field. To avoid confusion, the octahedral eg set becomes a tetrahedral e set, and the octahedral t2g set becomes a t2 set. Figure 19.36 This diagram shows the orientation of the tetrahedral ligands with respect to the axis system for the orbitals. Solution Since CFT is based on electrostatic repulsion, the orbitals closer to the ligands will be destabilized and raised in energy relative to the other set of orbitals. The splitting is less than for octahedral complexes ⎛ ⎞ 4 ⎝Δtet ⎠: = Δoct because the overlap is less, so Δtet is usually small 9 

--- Page 1120 ---
1112 Chapter 19 | Transition Metals and Coordination Chemistry Check Your Learning d4 Explain how many unpaired electrons a tetrahedral ion will have. Answer: 4; because Δtet is small, all tetrahedral complexes are high spin and the electrons go into the t2 orbitals before pairing The other common geometry is square planar. It is possible to consider a square planar geometry as an octahedral structure with a pair of trans ligands removed. The removed ligands are assumed to be on the z-axis. This changes the distribution of the d orbitals, as orbitals on or near the z-axis become more stable, and those on or near the x- or y-axes become less stable. This results in the octahedral t2g and the eg sets splitting and gives a more complicated pattern with no simple Δoct. The basic pattern is: Magnetic Moments of Molecules and Ions Experimental evidence of magnetic measurements supports the theory of high- and low-spin complexes. Remember that molecules such as O2 that contain unpaired electrons are paramagnetic. Paramagnetic substances are attracted to magnetic fields. Many transition metal complexes have unpaired electrons and hence are paramagnetic. Molecules Na+ [Fe(CN)6]4−that such as N2 and ions such as and contain no unpaired electrons are diamagnetic. Diamagnetic substances have a slight tendency to be repelled by magnetic fields. When an electron in an atom or ion is unpaired, the magnetic moment due to its spin makes the entire atom or ion paramagnetic. The size of the magnetic moment of a system containing unpaired electrons is related directly to the number of such electrons: the greater the number of unpaired electrons, the larger the magnetic moment. Therefore, the observed magnetic moment is used to determine the number of unpaired electrons present. The measured magnetic d6 [Fe(CN)6]4−confirms d6 [Fe(H2O)6]2+ moment of low-spin that iron is diamagnetic, whereas high-spin has four unpaired electrons with a magnetic moment that confirms this arrangement.

For coordination compounds, the energy difference between the d orbitals often allows photons in the visible range to be absorbed. The human eye perceives a mixture of all the colors, in the proportions present in sunlight, as white light. Complementary colors, those located across from each other on a color wheel, are also used in color vision. The eye perceives a mixture of two complementary colors, in the proper proportions, as white light. Likewise, when a color is missing from white light, the eye sees its complement. For example, when red photons are absorbed from white light, the eyes see the color green. When violet photons are removed from white light, the eyes see lemon yellow. The blue [Cu(NH3)4]2+ color of the ion results because this ion absorbs orange and red light, leaving the complementary colors (Figure 19.37). of blue and green Figure 19.37 (a) An object is black if it absorbs all colors of light.

Answer: red, 620–800 nm Small changes in the relative energies of the orbitals that electrons are transitioning between can lead to drastic shifts in the color of light absorbed. Therefore, the colors of coordination compounds depend on many factors. As shown Figure 19.38, in different aqueous metal ions can have different colors. In addition, different oxidation states of one metal can produce different colors, as shown for the vanadium complexes in the link below.

In general, strong-field ligands cause a large split in the energies of d orbitals of the central metal atom (large Δoct). Transition metal coordination compounds with these ligands are yellow, orange, or red because they absorb higher- energy violet or blue light. On the other hand, coordination compounds of transition metals with weak-field ligands are often blue-green, blue, or indigo because they absorb lower-energy yellow, orange, or red light.

To excite an electron to a higher level, such as the 4p orbital, photons of very high energy are necessary.

Chapter 19 | Transition Metals and Coordination Chemistry 1119 Summary 19.1 Occurrence, Preparation, and Properties of Transition Metals and Their Compounds The transition metals are elements with partially filled d orbitals, located in the d-block of the periodic table. The reactivity of the transition elements varies widely from very active metals such as scandium and iron to almost inert elements, such as the platinum metals. The type of chemistry used in the isolation of the elements from their ores depends upon the concentration of the element in its ore and the difficulty of reducing ions of the elements to the metals. Metals that are more active are more difficult to reduce. Transition metals exhibit chemical behavior typical of metals. For example, they oxidize in air upon heating and react with elemental halogens to form halides. Those elements that lie above hydrogen in the activity series react with acids, producing salts and hydrogen gas. Oxides, hydroxides, and carbonates of transition metal compounds in low oxidation states are basic. Halides and other salts are generally stable in water, although oxygen must be excluded in some cases. Most transition metals form a variety of stable oxidation states, allowing them to demonstrate a wide range of chemical reactivity. 19.2 Coordination Chemistry of Transition Metals The transition elements and main group elements can form coordination compounds, or complexes, in which a central metal atom or ion is bonded to one or more ligands by coordinate covalent bonds. Ligands with more than one donor atom are called polydentate ligands and form chelates. The common geometries found in complexes are tetrahedral and square planar (both with a coordination number of four) and octahedral (with a coordination number of six). Cis and trans configurations are possible in some octahedral and square planar complexes. In addition to these geometrical isomers, optical isomers (molecules or ions that are mirror images but not superimposable) are possible in certain octahedral complexes. Coordination complexes have a wide variety of uses including oxygen transport in blood, water purification, and pharmaceutical use. 19.3 Spectroscopic and Magnetic Properties of Coordination Compounds Crystal field theory treats interactions between the electrons on the metal and the ligands as a simple electrostatic effect. The presence of the ligands near the metal ion changes the energies of the metal d orbitals relative to their energies in the free ion. Both the color and the magnetic properties of a complex can be attributed to this crystal field splitting. The magnitude of the splitting (Δoct) depends on the nature of the ligands bonded to the metal. Strong-field ligands produce large splitting and favor low-spin complexes, in which the t2g orbitals are completely filled before any electrons occupy the eg orbitals. Weak-field ligands favor formation of high-spin complexes. The t2g and the eg orbitals are singly occupied before any are doubly occupied.

The prevalence of carbon compounds in living things has led to the epithet “carbon-based” life. The truth is we know of no other kind of life. Early chemists regarded substances isolated from organisms (plants and animals) as a different type of matter that could not be synthesized artificially, and these substances were thus known as organic compounds. The widespread belief called vitalism held that organic compounds were formed by a vital force present only in living organisms. The German chemist Friedrich Wohler was one of the early chemists to refute this aspect of vitalism, when, in 1828, he reported the synthesis of urea, a component of many body fluids, from nonliving materials. Since then, it has been recognized that organic molecules obey the same natural laws as inorganic substances, and the category of organic compounds has evolved to include both natural and synthetic compounds that contain carbon. Some carbon-containing compounds are not classified as organic, for example, carbonates and cyanides, and simple oxides, such as CO and CO2. Although a single, precise definition has yet to be identified by the chemistry community, most agree that a defining trait of organic molecules is the presence of carbon as the principal element, bonded to hydrogen and other carbon atoms. Today, organic compounds are key components of plastics, soaps, perfumes, sweeteners, fabrics, pharmaceuticals, and many other substances that we use every day. The value to us of organic compounds ensures that organic chemistry is an important discipline within the general field of chemistry. In this chapter, we discuss why the element carbon gives rise to a vast number and variety of compounds, how those compounds are classified, and the role of organic compounds in representative biological and industrial settings.

1126 Chapter 20 | Organic Chemistry 20.1 Hydrocarbons By the end of this section, you will be able to: Explain the importance of hydrocarbons and the reason for their diversity • Name saturated and unsaturated hydrocarbons, and molecules derived from them • Describe the reactions characteristic of saturated and unsaturated hydrocarbons • Identify structural and geometric isomers of hydrocarbons • database[1] The largest of organic compounds lists about 10 million substances, which include compounds originating from living organisms and those synthesized by chemists. The number of potential organic compounds has been estimated[2] 1060—an at astronomically high number. The existence of so many organic molecules is a consequence of the ability of carbon atoms to form up to four strong bonds to other carbon atoms, resulting in chains and rings of many different sizes, shapes, and complexities. The simplest organic compounds contain only the elements carbon and hydrogen, and are called hydrocarbons. Even though they are composed of only two types of atoms, there is a wide variety of hydrocarbons because they may consist of varying lengths of chains, branched chains, and rings of carbon atoms, or combinations of these structures. In addition, hydrocarbons may differ in the types of carbon-carbon bonds present in their molecules. Many hydrocarbons are found in plants, animals, and their fossils; other hydrocarbons have been prepared in the laboratory. We use hydrocarbons every day, mainly as fuels, such as natural gas, acetylene, propane, butane, and the principal components of gasoline, diesel fuel, and heating oil. The familiar plastics polyethylene, polypropylene, and polystyrene are also hydrocarbons. We can distinguish several types of hydrocarbons by differences in the bonding between carbon atoms. This leads to differences in geometries and in the hybridization of the carbon orbitals. Alkanes Alkanes, or saturated hydrocarbons, contain only single covalent bonds between carbon atoms. Each of the carbon sp3 atoms in an alkane has hybrid orbitals and is bonded to four other atoms, each of which is either carbon or Figure 20.2. hydrogen. The Lewis structures and models of methane, ethane, and pentane are illustrated in Carbon chains are usually drawn as straight lines in Lewis structures, but one has to remember that Lewis structures are not intended to indicate the geometry of molecules. Notice that the carbon atoms in the structural models (the ball-and- sp3 stick and space-filling models) of the pentane molecule do not lie in a straight line. Because of the hybridization, the bond angles in carbon chains are close to 109.5°, giving such chains in an alkane a zigzag shape. The structures of alkanes and other organic molecules may also be represented in a less detailed manner by condensed structural formulas (or simply, condensed formulas). Instead of the usual format for chemical formulas in which each element symbol appears just once, a condensed formula is written to suggest the bonding in the molecule. These formulas have the appearance of a Lewis structure from which most or all of the bond symbols have been removed. Figure 20.2, Condensed structural formulas for ethane and pentane are shown at the bottom of and several additional examples are provided in the exercises at the end of this chapter. 1.

A common method used by organic chemists to simplify the drawings of larger molecules is to use a skeletal structure (also called a line-angle structure). In this type of structure, carbon atoms are not symbolized with a C, but represented by each end of a line or bend in a line. Hydrogen atoms are not drawn if they are attached to a carbon.

The number of carbon atoms present in an alkane has no limit. Greater numbers of atoms in the molecules will lead to stronger intermolecular attractions (dispersion forces) and correspondingly different physical properties of the molecules. Properties such as melting point and boiling point (Table 20.1) usually change smoothly and predictably as the number of carbon and hydrogen atoms in the molecules change.

1130 Chapter 20 | Organic Chemistry Hydrocarbons with the same formula, including alkanes, can have different structures. For example, two alkanes have the formula C4H10: They are called n-butane and 2-methylpropane (or isobutane), and have the following Lewis structures: The compounds n-butane and 2-methylpropane are structural isomers (the term constitutional isomers is also commonly used). Constitutional isomers have the same molecular formula but different spatial arrangements of the atoms in their molecules. The n-butane molecule contains an unbranched chain, meaning that no carbon atom is bonded to more than two other carbon atoms. We use the term normal, or the prefix n, to refer to a chain of carbon atoms without branching. The compound 2–methylpropane has a branched chain (the carbon atom in the center of the Lewis structure is bonded to three other carbon atoms) Identifying isomers from Lewis structures is not as easy as it looks. Lewis structures that look different may actually Figure 20.4 represent the same isomers. For example, the three structures in all represent the same molecule, n- not different isomers. They are identical because each contains an unbranched chain of four butane, and hence are carbon atoms. https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

The Basics of Organic Nomenclature: Naming Alkanes The International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) has devised a system of nomenclature that begins with the names of the alkanes and can be adjusted from there to account for more complicated structures. The nomenclature for alkanes is based on two rules: To name an alkane, first identify the longest chain of carbon atoms in its structure. A two-carbon chain is 1. called ethane; a three-carbon chain, propane; and a four-carbon chain, butane. Longer chains are named as follows: pentane (five-carbon chain), hexane (6), heptane (7), octane (8), nonane (9), and decane (10). These Table 20.1. prefixes can be seen in the names of the alkanes described in Add prefixes to the name of the longest chain to indicate the positions and names of substituents. Substituents 2. are branches or functional groups that replace hydrogen atoms on a chain. The position of a substituent or branch is identified by the number of the carbon atom it is bonded to in the chain. We number the carbon atoms in the chain by counting from the end of the chain nearest the substituents. Multiple substituents are named individually and placed in alphabetical order at the front of the name. When more than one substituent is present, either on the same carbon atom or on different carbon atoms, the substituents are listed alphabetically. Because the carbon atom numbering begins at the end closest to a substituent, the longest chain of carbon atoms is numbered in such a way as to produce the lowest number for the substituents. The ending -o replaces -ide at the end of the name of an electronegative substituent (in ionic compounds, the negatively charged ion ends with -ide like chloride; in organic compounds, such atoms are treated as substituents and the -o 

--- Page 1140 ---
1132 Chapter 20 | Organic Chemistry ending is used). The number of substituents of the same type is indicated by the prefixes di- (two), tri- (three), tetra- (four), and so on (for example, difluoro- indicates two fluoride substituents). Example 20.3 Naming Halogen-substituted Alkanes Name the molecule whose structure is shown here: Solution The four-carbon chain is numbered from the end with the chlorine atom. This puts the substituents on positions 1 and 2 (numbering from the other end would put the substituents on positions 3 and 4). Four carbon atoms means that the base name of this compound will be butane. The bromine at position 2 will be described by adding 2-bromo-; this will come at the beginning of the name, since bromo- comes before chloro- alphabetically. The chlorine at position 1 will be described by adding 1-chloro-, resulting in the name of the molecule being 2-bromo-1-chlorobutane. Check Your Learning Name the following molecule: Answer: 3,3-dibromo-2-iodopentane We call a substituent that contains one less hydrogen than the corresponding alkane an alkyl group. The name of an alkyl group is obtained by dropping the suffix -ane of the alkane name and adding -yl: The open bonds in the methyl and ethyl groups indicate that these alkyl groups are bonded to another atom.

Chapter 20 | Organic Chemistry 1133 Solution The longest carbon chain runs horizontally across the page and contains six carbon atoms (this makes the base of the name hexane, but we will also need to incorporate the name of the branch). In this case, we want to number from right to left (as shown by the red numbers) so the branch is connected to carbon 3 (imagine the numbers from left to right—this would put the branch on carbon 4, violating our rules). The branch attached to position 3 of our chain contains two carbon atoms (numbered in blue)—so we take our name for two carbons eth- and attach -yl at the end to signify we are describing a branch. Putting all the pieces together, this molecule is 3-ethylhexane. Check Your Learning Name the following molecule: Answer: 4-propyloctane Some hydrocarbons can form more than one type of alkyl group when the hydrogen atoms that would be removed have different “environments” in the molecule. This diversity of possible alkyl groups can be identified in the following way: The four hydrogen atoms in a methane molecule are equivalent; they all have the same environment. They are equivalent because each is bonded to a carbon atom (the same carbon atom) that is bonded to three hydrogen Figure 20.2. atoms. (It may be easier to see the equivalency in the ball and stick models in Removal of any one of the four hydrogen atoms from methane forms a methyl group. Likewise, the six hydrogen atoms in ethane are equivalent (Figure 20.2) and removing any one of these hydrogen atoms produces an ethyl group. Each of the six hydrogen atoms is bonded to a carbon atom that is bonded to two other hydrogen atoms and a carbon atom. However, in both propane and 2–methylpropane, there are hydrogen atoms in two different environments, distinguished by the adjacent atoms or groups of atoms: 

--- Page 1142 ---
1134 Chapter 20 | Organic Chemistry Each of the six equivalent hydrogen atoms of the first type in propane and each of the nine equivalent hydrogen atoms of that type in 2-methylpropane (all shown in black) are bonded to a carbon atom that is bonded to only one other carbon atom. The two purple hydrogen atoms in propane are of a second type. They differ from the six hydrogen atoms of the first type in that they are bonded to a carbon atom bonded to two other carbon atoms. The green hydrogen atom in 2-methylpropane differs from the other nine hydrogen atoms in that molecule and from the purple hydrogen atoms in propane. The green hydrogen atom in 2-methylpropane is bonded to a carbon atom bonded to three other carbon atoms. Two different alkyl groups can be formed from each of these molecules, depending on which hydrogen Figure 20.5. atom is removed. The names and structures of these and several other alkyl groups are listed in Figure 20.5 This listing gives the names and formulas for various alkyl groups formed by the removal of hydrogen atoms from different locations. Note that alkyl groups do not exist as stable independent entities. They are always a part of some larger molecule. The location of an alkyl group on a hydrocarbon chain is indicated in the same way as any other substituent: https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

Chapter 20 | Organic Chemistry 1135 Alkanes are relatively stable molecules, but heat or light will activate reactions that involve the breaking of C–H or C–C single bonds. Combustion is one such reaction: O(g) CH4(g) + 2O2(g) ⟶CO2(g) + 2H2 Alkanes burn in the presence of oxygen, a highly exothermic oxidation-reduction reaction that produces carbon dioxide and water. As a consequence, alkanes are excellent fuels. For example, methane, CH4, is the principal component of natural gas. Butane, C4H10, used in camping stoves and lighters is an alkane. Gasoline is a liquid mixture of continuous- and branched-chain alkanes, each containing from five to nine carbon atoms, plus various additives to improve its performance as a fuel. Kerosene, diesel oil, and fuel oil are primarily mixtures of alkanes with higher molecular masses. The main source of these liquid alkane fuels is crude oil, a complex mixture that is separated by fractional distillation. Fractional distillation takes advantage of differences in the boiling points of the components Figure 20.6). of the mixture (see You may recall that boiling point is a function of intermolecular interactions, which was discussed in the chapter on solutions and colloids. Figure 20.6 In a column for the fractional distillation of crude oil, oil heated to about 425 °C in the furnace vaporizes when it enters the base of the tower. The vapors rise through bubble caps in a series of trays in the tower. As the vapors gradually cool, fractions of higher, then of lower, boiling points condense to liquids and are drawn off.

1136 Chapter 20 | Organic Chemistry In a substitution reaction, another typical reaction of alkanes, one or more of the alkane’s hydrogen atoms is replaced with a different atom or group of atoms. No carbon-carbon bonds are broken in these reactions, and the hybridization of the carbon atoms does not change. For example, the reaction between ethane and molecular chlorine depicted here is a substitution reaction: The C–Cl portion of the chloroethane molecule is an example of a functional group, the part or moiety of a molecule that imparts a specific chemical reactivity. The types of functional groups present in an organic molecule are major determinants of its chemical properties and are used as a means of classifying organic compounds as detailed in the remaining sections of this chapter.

Alkenes Organic compounds that contain one or more double or triple bonds between carbon atoms are described as unsaturated. You have likely heard of unsaturated fats. These are complex organic molecules with long chains of carbon atoms, which contain at least one double bond between carbon atoms. Unsaturated hydrocarbon molecules that contain one or more double bonds are called alkenes. Carbon atoms linked by a double bond are bound together by two bonds, one σ bond and one π bond. Double and triple bonds give rise to a different geometry around the carbon atom that participates in them, leading to important differences in molecular shape and properties. The differing geometries are responsible for the different properties of unsaturated versus saturated fats. Ethene, C2H4, is the simplest alkene. Each carbon atom in ethene, commonly called ethylene, has a trigonal planar (Figure 20.7); structure. The second member of the series is propene (propylene) the butene isomers follow in the series. Four carbon atoms in the chain of butene allows for the formation of isomers based on the position of the double bond, as well as a new form of isomerism. https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

Chapter 20 | Organic Chemistry 1137 Figure 20.7 Expanded structures, ball-and-stick structures, and space-filling models for the alkenes ethene, propene, and 1-butene are shown. Ethylene (the common industrial name for ethene) is a basic raw material in the production of polyethylene and other important compounds. Over 135 million tons of ethylene were produced worldwide in 2010 for use in the polymer, petrochemical, and plastic industries. Ethylene is produced industrially in a process called cracking, in which the long hydrocarbon chains in a petroleum mixture are broken into smaller molecules. Chemistry in Everyday Life Recycling Plastics Polymers (from Greek words poly meaning “many” and mer meaning “parts”) are large molecules made up of repeating units, referred to as monomers. Polymers can be natural (starch is a polymer of sugar residues and proteins are polymers of amino acids) or synthetic [like polyethylene, polyvinyl chloride (PVC), and polystyrene]. The variety of structures of polymers translates into a broad range of properties and uses that make them integral parts of our everyday lives. Adding functional groups to the structure of a polymer can result in significantly different properties (see the discussion about Kevlar later in this chapter). An example of a polymerization reaction is shown in Figure 20.8. The monomer ethylene (C2H4) is a gas at room temperature, but when polymerized, using a transition metal catalyst, it is transformed into a solid material made up of long chains of –CH2– units called polyethylene. Polyethylene is a commodity plastic used primarily for packaging (bags and films). 

--- Page 1146 ---
1138 Chapter 20 | Organic Chemistry Figure 20.8 The reaction for the polymerization of ethylene to polyethylene is shown. Polyethylene is a member of one subset of synthetic polymers classified as plastics. Plastics are synthetic organic solids that can be molded; they are typically organic polymers with high molecular masses. Most of the monomers that go into common plastics (ethylene, propylene, vinyl chloride, styrene, and ethylene terephthalate) are derived from petrochemicals and are not very biodegradable, making them candidate materials for recycling. Recycling plastics helps minimize the need for using more of the petrochemical supplies and also minimizes the environmental damage caused by throwing away these nonbiodegradable materials. Plastic recycling is the process of recovering waste, scrap, or used plastics, and reprocessing the material into useful products. For example, polyethylene terephthalate (soft drink bottles) can be melted down and used for plastic furniture, in carpets, or for other applications. Other plastics, like polyethylene (bags) and polypropylene (cups, plastic food containers), can be recycled or reprocessed to be used again. Many areas of the country have recycling programs that focus on one or more of the commodity plastics that have been assigned a recycling code (see Figure 20.9). These operations have been in effect since the 1970s and have made the production of some plastics among the most efficient industrial operations today. https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

Chapter 20 | Organic Chemistry 1139 Figure 20.9 Each type of recyclable plastic is imprinted with a code for easy identification. The name of an alkene is derived from the name of the alkane with the same number of carbon atoms. The presence of the double bond is signified by replacing the suffix -ane with the suffix -ene. The location of the double bond is identified by naming the smaller of the numbers of the carbon atoms participating in the double bond: Isomers of Alkenes Molecules of 1-butene and 2-butene are structural isomers; the arrangement of the atoms in these two molecules differs. As an example of arrangement differences, the first carbon atom in 1-butene is bonded to two hydrogen atoms; the first carbon atom in 2-butene is bonded to three hydrogen atoms. The compound 2-butene and some other alkenes also form a second type of isomer called a geometric isomer. In a set of geometric isomers, the same types of atoms are attached to each other in the same order, but the geometries of the 

--- Page 1148 ---
1140 Chapter 20 | Organic Chemistry C = C two molecules differ. Geometric isomers of alkenes differ in the orientation of the groups on either side of a bond. Carbon atoms are free to rotate around a single bond but not around a double bond; a double bond is rigid. This makes it possible to have two isomers of 2-butene, one with both methyl groups on the same side of the double bond and one with the methyl groups on opposite sides. When structures of butene are drawn with 120° bond angles around sp2-hybridized the carbon atoms participating in the double bond, the isomers are apparent. The 2-butene isomer in which the two methyl groups are on the same side is called a cis-isomer; the one in which the two methyl groups (Figure 20.10). are on opposite sides is called a trans-isomer The different geometries produce different physical properties, such as boiling point, that may make separation of the isomers possible: Figure 20.10 These molecular models show the structural and geometric isomers of butene. C = C Alkenes are much more reactive than alkanes because the moiety is a reactive functional group. A π bond, being a weaker bond, is disrupted much more easily than a σ bond. Thus, alkenes undergo a characteristic reaction in which the π bond is broken and replaced by two σ bonds. This reaction is called an addition reaction. The sp2 sp3 hybridization of the carbon atoms in the double bond in an alkene changes from to during an addition reaction. For example, halogens add to the double bond in an alkene instead of replacing hydrogen, as occurs in an alkane: Example 20.5 Alkene Reactivity and Naming Provide the IUPAC names for the reactant and product of the halogenation reaction shown here: https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

Chapter 20 | Organic Chemistry 1141 Solution The reactant is a five-carbon chain that contains a carbon-carbon double bond, so the base name will be pentene. We begin counting at the end of the chain closest to the double bond—in this case, from the left—the double bond spans carbons 2 and 3, so the name becomes 2-pentene. Since there are two carbon- containing groups attached to the two carbon atoms in the double bond—and they are on the same side of the double bond—this molecule is the cis-isomer, making the name of the starting alkene cis-2-pentene. The product of the halogenation reaction will have two chlorine atoms attached to the carbon atoms that were a part of the carbon-carbon double bond: This molecule is now a substituted alkane and will be named as such. The base of the name will be pentane. We will count from the end that numbers the carbon atoms where the chlorine atoms are attached as 2 and 3, making the name of the product 2,3-dichloropentane. Check Your Learning Provide names for the reactant and product of the reaction shown: Answer: reactant: trans-3-hexene, product: 3,4-dichlorohexane Alkynes Hydrocarbon molecules with one or more triple bonds are called alkynes; they make up another series of unsaturated hydrocarbons. Two carbon atoms joined by a triple bond are bound together by one σ bond and two π bonds. The sp- hybridized carbons involved in the triple bond have bond angles of 180°, giving these types of bonds a linear, rod-like shape. The simplest member of the alkyne series is ethyne, C2H2, commonly called acetylene. The Lewis structure for ethyne, a linear molecule, is: The IUPAC nomenclature for alkynes is similar to that for alkenes except that the suffix -yne is used to indicate a CH3 CH2 C ≡CH triple bond in the chain. For example, is called 1-butyne. Example 20.6

Since the typically react even more readily, and react with twice as much reagent in addition reactions. The reaction of acetylene with bromine is a typical example: Acetylene and the other alkynes also burn readily. An acetylene torch takes advantage of the high heat of combustion for acetylene. Aromatic Hydrocarbons Benzene, C6H6, is the simplest member of a large family of hydrocarbons, called aromatic hydrocarbons. These compounds contain ring structures and exhibit bonding that must be described using the resonance hybrid concept of valence bond theory or the delocalization concept of molecular orbital theory. (To review these concepts, refer to the earlier chapters on chemical bonding). The resonance structures for benzene, C6H6, are: Valence bond theory describes the benzene molecule and other planar aromatic hydrocarbon molecules as hexagonal sp2-hybridized rings of carbon atoms with the unhybridized p orbital of each carbon atom perpendicular to the plane sp2 of the ring. Three valence electrons in the hybrid orbitals of each carbon atom and the valence electron of each hydrogen atom form the framework of σ bonds in the benzene molecule. The fourth valence electron of each carbon atom is shared with an adjacent carbon atom in their unhybridized p orbitals to yield the π bonds.

Each of the six bonds between its carbon atoms is equivalent C = C and exhibits properties that are intermediate between those of a C–C single bond and a double bond. To represent this unique bonding, structural formulas for benzene and its derivatives are typically drawn with single Figure 20.11. bonds between the carbon atoms and a circle within the ring as shown in Figure 20.11 This condensed formula shows the unique bonding structure of benzene. There are many derivatives of benzene. The hydrogen atoms can be replaced by many different substituents. Aromatic compounds more readily undergo substitution reactions than addition reactions; replacement of one of the hydrogen atoms with another substituent will leave the delocalized double bonds intact. The following are typical examples of substituted benzene derivatives: Toluene and xylene are important solvents and raw materials in the chemical industry. Styrene is used to produce the polymer polystyrene.

Draw two other possible isomers in which the chlorine atom replaces a different hydrogen atom attached to the aromatic ring: Solution Since the six-carbon ring with alternating double bonds is necessary for the molecule to be classified as aromatic, appropriate isomers can be produced only by changing the positions of the chloro-substituent relative to the methyl-substituent:

Answer: 20.2 Alcohols and Ethers By the end of this section, you will be able to: Describe the structure and properties of alcohols • Describe the structure and properties of ethers • Name and draw structures for alcohols and ethers • In this section, we will learn about alcohols and ethers. Alcohols Incorporation of an oxygen atom into carbon- and hydrogen-containing molecules leads to new functional groups and new families of compounds. When the oxygen atom is attached by single bonds, the molecule is either an alcohol or ether. Alcohols are derivatives of hydrocarbons in which an –OH group has replaced a hydrogen atom. Although all alcohols have one or more hydroxyl (–OH) functional groups, they do not behave like bases such as NaOH and KOH. OH– NaOH and KOH are ionic compounds that contain ions. Alcohols are covalent molecules; the –OH group in an alcohol molecule is attached to a carbon atom by a covalent bond. Ethanol, CH3CH2OH, also called ethyl alcohol, is a particularly important alcohol for human use. Ethanol is the alcohol produced by some species of yeast that is found in wine, beer, and distilled drinks. It has long been prepared by humans harnessing the metabolic efforts of yeasts in fermenting various sugars: https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

Chapter 20 | Organic Chemistry 1145 Large quantities of ethanol are synthesized from the addition reaction of water with ethylene using an acid as a catalyst: Alcohols containing two or more hydroxyl groups can be made. Examples include 1,2-ethanediol (ethylene glycol, used in antifreeze) and 1,2,3-propanetriol (glycerine, used as a solvent for cosmetics and medicines): Naming Alcohols The name of an alcohol comes from the hydrocarbon from which it was derived. The final -e in the name of the hydrocarbon is replaced by -ol, and the carbon atom to which the –OH group is bonded is indicated by a number name.[5] placed before the Example 20.8 Naming Alcohols Consider the following example. How should it be named? Solution The carbon chain contains five carbon atoms. If the hydroxyl group was not present, we would have named this molecule pentane. To address the fact that the hydroxyl group is present, we change the ending of the name to -ol. In this case, since the –OH is attached to carbon 2 in the chain, we would name this molecule 2-pentanol. Check Your Learning Name the following molecule: 5. The IUPAC adopted new nomenclature guidelines in 2013 that require this number to be placed as an “infix” rather than a prefix. For example, the new name for 2-propanol would be propan-2-ol. Widespread adoption of this new nomenclature will take some time, and students are encouraged to be familiar with both the old and new naming protocols.

1146 Chapter 20 | Organic Chemistry Answer: 2-methyl-2-pentanol Ethers Ethers are compounds that contain the functional group –O–. Ethers do not have a designated suffix like the other types of molecules we have named so far. In the IUPAC system, the oxygen atom and the smaller carbon branch are named as an alkoxy substituent and the remainder of the molecule as the base chain, as in alkanes. As shown in the following compound, the red symbols represent the smaller alkyl group and the oxygen atom, which would be named “methoxy.” The larger carbon branch would be ethane, making the molecule methoxyethane. Many ethers are referred to with common names instead of the IUPAC system names. For common names, the two branches connected to the oxygen atom are named separately and followed by “ether.” The common name for the compound shown in Example 20.9 is ethylmethyl ether: Example 20.9 Naming Ethers Provide the IUPAC and common name for the ether shown here: Solution IUPAC: The molecule is made up of an ethoxy group attached to an ethane chain, so the IUPAC name would be ethoxyethane. Common: The groups attached to the oxygen atom are both ethyl groups, so the common name would be diethyl ether. Check Your Learning Provide the IUPAC and common name for the ether shown: Answer: IUPAC: 2-methoxypropane; common: isopropylmethyl ether Ethers can be obtained from alcohols by the elimination of a molecule of water from two molecules of the alcohol. For example, when ethanol is treated with a limited amount of sulfuric acid and heated to 140 °C, diethyl ether and water are formed: In the general formula for ethers, R—O—R, the hydrocarbon groups (R) may be the same or different.

Diethyl ether and other ethers are presently used primarily as solvents for gums, fats, waxes, and resins. Tertiary-butyl methyl ether, C4H9OCH3 (abbreviated MTBE—italicized portions of names are not counted when ranking the groups alphabetically—so butyl comes before methyl in the common name), is used as an additive for gasoline. MTBE belongs to a group of chemicals known as oxygenates due to their capacity to increase the oxygen content of gasoline. Link to Learning Want more practice naming ethers? This brief video review (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/16ethers) summarizes the nomenclature for ethers. Chemistry in Everyday Life Carbohydrates and Diabetes Carbohydrates are large biomolecules made up of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. The dietary forms of carbohydrates are foods rich in these types of molecules, like pastas, bread, and candy. The name “carbohydrate” comes from the formula of the molecules, which can be described by the general formula Cm(H2O)n, which shows that they are in a sense “carbon and water” or “hydrates of carbon.” In many cases, m and n have the same value, but they can be different. The smaller carbohydrates are generally referred to as “sugars,” the biochemical term for this group of molecules is “saccharide” from the Greek word for sugar (Figure 20.12). Depending on the number of sugar units joined together, they may be classified as monosaccharides (one sugar unit), disaccharides (two sugar units), oligosaccharides (a few sugars), or polysaccharides (the polymeric version of sugars—polymers were described in the feature box earlier in this chapter on recycling plastics). The scientific names of sugars can be recognized by the suffix -ose at the end of the name (for instance, fruit sugar is a monosaccharide called “fructose” and milk sugar is a disaccharide called lactose composed of two monosaccharides, glucose and galactose, connected together). Sugars contain some of the functional groups we have discussed: Note the alcohol groups present in the structures and how monosaccharide units are linked to form a disaccharide by formation of an ether. 

--- Page 1156 ---
1148 Chapter 20 | Organic Chemistry Figure 20.12 The illustrations show the molecular structures of fructose, a five-carbon monosaccharide, and of lactose, a disaccharide composed of two isomeric, six-carbon sugars. Organisms use carbohydrates for a variety of functions. Carbohydrates can store energy, such as the polysaccharides glycogen in animals or starch in plants. They also provide structural support, such as the polysaccharide cellulose in plants and the modified polysaccharide chitin in fungi and animals. The sugars ribose and deoxyribose are components of the backbones of RNA and DNA, respectively. Other sugars play key roles in the function of the immune system, in cell-cell recognition, and in many other biological roles. Diabetes is a group of metabolic diseases in which a person has a high sugar concentration in their blood (Figure 20.13). Diabetes may be caused by insufficient insulin production by the pancreas or by the body’s cells not responding properly to the insulin that is produced. In a healthy person, insulin is produced when it is needed and functions to transport glucose from the blood into the cells where it can be used for energy. The long-term complications of diabetes can include loss of eyesight, heart disease, and kidney failure. In 2013, it was estimated that approximately 3.3% of the world’s population (~380 million people) suffered from diabetes, resulting in over a million deaths annually. Prevention involves eating a healthy diet, getting plenty of exercise, and maintaining a normal body weight.

The trigonal planar carbon in the carbonyl group can attach to two other substituents leading to several subfamilies (aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic acids and esters) described in this section. Aldehydes and Ketones Both aldehydes and ketones contain a carbonyl group, a functional group with a carbon-oxygen double bond. The names for aldehyde and ketone compounds are derived using similar nomenclature rules as for alkanes and alcohols, and include the class-identifying suffixes -al and -one, respectively: In an aldehyde, the carbonyl group is bonded to at least one hydrogen atom. In a ketone, the carbonyl group is bonded to two carbon atoms: 

--- Page 1158 ---
1150 Chapter 20 | Organic Chemistry As text, an aldehyde group is represented as –CHO; a ketone is represented as –C(O)– or –CO–. In both aldehydes and ketones, the geometry around the carbon atom in the carbonyl group is trigonal planar; the sp2 sp2 carbon atom exhibits hybridization. Two of the orbitals on the carbon atom in the carbonyl group are used to sp2 form σ bonds to the other carbon or hydrogen atoms in a molecule. The remaining hybrid orbital forms a σ bond to the oxygen atom. The unhybridized p orbital on the carbon atom in the carbonyl group overlaps a p orbital on the oxygen atom to form the π bond in the double bond. C = O C = O bond in carbon dioxide, the bond of a carbonyl group is polar (recall that oxygen is Like the significantly more electronegative than carbon, and the shared electrons are pulled toward the oxygen atom and away from the carbon atom). Many of the reactions of aldehydes and ketones start with the reaction between a Lewis base C = O and the carbon atom at the positive end of the polar bond to yield an unstable intermediate that subsequently (Figure 20.14). undergoes one or more structural rearrangements to form the final product Figure 20.14 The carbonyl group is polar, and the geometry of the bonds around the central carbon is trigonal planar. The importance of molecular structure in the reactivity of organic compounds is illustrated by the reactions that produce aldehydes and ketones. We can prepare a carbonyl group by oxidation of an alcohol—for organic molecules, oxidation of a carbon atom is said to occur when a carbon-hydrogen bond is replaced by a carbon-oxygen bond. The reverse reaction—replacing a carbon-oxygen bond by a carbon-hydrogen bond—is a reduction of that carbon atom. Recall that oxygen is generally assigned a –2 oxidation number unless it is elemental or attached to a fluorine. Hydrogen is generally assigned an oxidation number of +1 unless it is attached to a metal. Since carbon does not have a specific rule, its oxidation number is determined algebraically by factoring the atoms it is attached to and the overall charge of the molecule or ion. In general, a carbon atom attached to an oxygen atom will have a more positive oxidation number and a carbon atom attached to a hydrogen atom will have a more negative oxidation number. This should fit nicely with your understanding of the polarity of C–O and C–H bonds. The other reagents and possible products of these reactions are beyond the scope of this chapter, so we will focus only on the changes to the carbon atoms: Example 20.10 https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

Sequentially replacing each of the carbon-hydrogen bonds with a carbon-oxygen bond would lead to an alcohol, then an aldehyde, then a carboxylic acid (discussed later), and, finally, carbon dioxide: CH4 ⟶CH3 OH ⟶CH2 O ⟶HCO2 H ⟶CO2 What are the oxidation numbers for the carbon atoms in the molecules shown here? Solution In this example, we can calculate the oxidation number (review the chapter on oxidation-reduction reactions if necessary) for the carbon atom in each case (note how this would become difficult for larger molecules with additional carbon atoms and hydrogen atoms, which is why organic chemists use the definition dealing with replacing C–H bonds with C–O bonds described). For CH4, the carbon atom carries a –4 oxidation number (the hydrogen atoms are assigned oxidation numbers of +1 and the carbon atom balances that by having an oxidation number of –4). For the alcohol (in this case, methanol), the carbon atom has an oxidation number of –2 (the oxygen atom is assigned –2, the four hydrogen atoms each are assigned +1, and the carbon atom balances the sum by having an oxidation number of –2; note that compared to the carbon atom in CH4, this carbon atom has lost two electrons so it was oxidized); for the aldehyde, the carbon atom’s oxidation number is 0 (–2 for the oxygen atom and +1 for each hydrogen atom already balances to 0, so the oxidation number for the carbon atom is 0); for the carboxylic acid, the carbon atom’s oxidation number is +2 (two oxygen atoms each at –2 and two hydrogen atoms at +1); and for carbon dioxide, the carbon atom’s oxidation number is +4 (here, the carbon atom needs to balance the –4 sum from the two oxygen atoms). Check Your Learning Indicate whether the marked carbon atoms in the three molecules here are oxidized or reduced relative to the marked carbon atom in ethanol: There is no need to calculate oxidation states in this case; instead, just compare the types of atoms bonded to the marked carbon atoms: Answer: (a) reduced (bond to oxygen atom replaced by bond to hydrogen atom); (b) oxidized (one bond to hydrogen atom replaced by one bond to oxygen atom); (c) oxidized (2 bonds to hydrogen atoms have been replaced by bonds to an oxygen atom) Aldehydes are commonly prepared by the oxidation of alcohols whose –OH functional group is located on the carbon atom at the end of the chain of carbon atoms in the alcohol: Alcohols that have their –OH groups in the middle of the chain are necessary to synthesize a ketone, which requires the carbonyl group to be bonded to two other carbon atoms:

1152 Chapter 20 | Organic Chemistry An alcohol with its –OH group bonded to a carbon atom that is bonded to no or one other carbon atom will form an aldehyde. An alcohol with its –OH group attached to two other carbon atoms will form a ketone. If three carbons are attached to the carbon bonded to the –OH, the molecule will not have a C–H bond to be replaced, so it will not be susceptible to oxidation. Formaldehyde, an aldehyde with the formula HCHO, is a colorless gas with a pungent and irritating odor. It is sold in an aqueous solution called formalin, which contains about 37% formaldehyde by weight. Formaldehyde causes coagulation of proteins, so it kills bacteria (and any other living organism) and stops many of the biological processes that cause tissue to decay. Thus, formaldehyde is used for preserving tissue specimens and embalming bodies. It is also used to sterilize soil or other materials. Formaldehyde is used in the manufacture of Bakelite, a hard plastic having high chemical and electrical resistance. Dimethyl ketone, CH3COCH3, commonly called acetone, is the simplest ketone. It is made commercially by fermenting corn or molasses, or by oxidation of 2-propanol. Acetone is a colorless liquid. Among its many uses are as a solvent for lacquer (including fingernail polish), cellulose acetate, cellulose nitrate, acetylene, plastics, and varnishes; as a paint and varnish remover; and as a solvent in the manufacture of pharmaceuticals and chemicals. Carboxylic Acids and Esters The odor of vinegar is caused by the presence of acetic acid, a carboxylic acid, in the vinegar. The odor of ripe bananas and many other fruits is due to the presence of esters, compounds that can be prepared by the reaction of a carboxylic acid with an alcohol. Because esters do not have hydrogen bonds between molecules, they have lower vapor pressures Figure 20.15). than the alcohols and carboxylic acids from which they are derived (see Figure 20.15 Esters are responsible for the odors associated with various plants and their fruits. Both carboxylic acids and esters contain a carbonyl group with a second oxygen atom bonded to the carbon atom in the carbonyl group by a single bond. In a carboxylic acid, the second oxygen atom also bonds to a hydrogen atom. In an ester, the second oxygen atom bonds to another carbon atom.

Chapter 20 | Organic Chemistry 1153 prefixes that denote the lengths of the carbon chains in the molecules and are derived following nomenclature rules similar to those for inorganic acids and salts (see these examples): The functional groups for an acid and for an ester are shown in red in these formulas. The hydrogen atom in the functional group of a carboxylic acid will react with a base to form an ionic salt: Carboxylic acids are weak acids (see the chapter on acids and bases), meaning they are not 100% ionized in water. Generally only about 1% of the molecules of a carboxylic acid dissolved in water are ionized at any given time. The remaining molecules are undissociated in solution. We prepare carboxylic acids by the oxidation of aldehydes or alcohols whose –OH functional group is located on the carbon atom at the end of the chain of carbon atoms in the alcohol: Esters are produced by the reaction of acids with alcohols. For example, the ester ethyl acetate, CH3CO2CH2CH3, is formed when acetic acid reacts with ethanol: The simplest carboxylic acid is formic acid, HCO2H, known since 1670. Its name comes from the Latin word formicus, which means “ant”; it was first isolated by the distillation of red ants. It is partially responsible for the pain and irritation of ant and wasp stings, and is responsible for a characteristic odor of ants that can be sometimes detected in their nests. Acetic acid, CH3CO2H, constitutes 3–6% vinegar. Cider vinegar is produced by allowing apple juice to ferment without oxygen present. Yeast cells present in the juice carry out the fermentation reactions. The fermentation reactions change the sugar present in the juice to ethanol, then to acetic acid. Pure acetic acid has a penetrating odor and produces painful burns. It is an excellent solvent for many organic and some inorganic compounds, and it is essential in the production of cellulose acetate, a component of many synthetic fibers such as rayon. The distinctive and attractive odors and flavors of many flowers, perfumes, and ripe fruits are due to the presence (Figure 20.16). of one or more esters Among the most important of the natural esters are fats (such as lard, tallow,

1154 Chapter 20 | Organic Chemistry and butter) and oils (such as linseed, cottonseed, and olive oils), which are esters of the trihydroxyl alcohol glycerine, C3H5(OH)3, with large carboxylic acids, such as palmitic acid, CH3(CH2)14CO2H, stearic acid, CH3(CH2)16CO2H, CH3(CH2)7 CH = CH(CH2)7 CO2 H. C = C and oleic acid, Oleic acid is an unsaturated acid; it contains a double bond. Palmitic and stearic acids are saturated acids that contain no double or triple bonds. Figure 20.16 Over 350 different volatile molecules (many members of the ester family) have been identified in strawberries. (credit: Rebecca Siegel) 20.4 Amines and Amides By the end of this section, you will be able to: Describe the structure and properties of an amine • Describe the structure and properties of an amide • Amines are molecules that contain carbon-nitrogen bonds. The nitrogen atom in an amine has a lone pair of electrons and three bonds to other atoms, either carbon or hydrogen. Various nomenclatures are used to derive names for amines, but all involve the class-identifying suffix –ine as illustrated here for a few simple examples: (Figure 20.17) In some amines, the nitrogen atom replaces a carbon atom in an aromatic hydrocarbon. Pyridine is one such heterocyclic amine. A heterocyclic compound contains atoms of two or more different elements in its ring structure.

Chapter 20 | Organic Chemistry 1155 How Sciences Interconnect DNA in Forensics and Paternity The genetic material for all living things is a polymer of four different molecules, which are themselves a combination of three subunits. The genetic information, the code for developing an organism, is contained in the specific sequence of the four molecules, similar to the way the letters of the alphabet can be sequenced to form words that convey information. The information in a DNA sequence is used to form two other types of polymers, one of which are proteins. The proteins interact to form a specific type of organism with individual characteristics. A genetic molecule is called DNA, which stands for deoxyribonucleic acid. The four molecules that make up DNA are called nucleotides. Each nucleotide consists of a single- or double-ringed molecule containing nitrogen, carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen called a nitrogenous base. Each base is bonded to a five-carbon sugar 3−) (−PO4 When new DNA is made, called deoxyribose. The sugar is in turn bonded to a phosphate group a polymerization reaction occurs that binds the phosphate group of one nucleotide to the sugar group of a second nucleotide. The nitrogenous bases of each nucleotide stick out from this sugar-phosphate backbone. DNA is actually formed from two such polymers coiled around each other and held together by hydrogen bonds between the nitrogenous bases. Thus, the two backbones are on the outside of the coiled pair of strands, and the bases are on the inside. The shape of the two strands wound around each other is called a double helix (see Figure 20.18). It probably makes sense that the sequence of nucleotides in the DNA of a cat differs from those of a dog. But it is also true that the sequences of the DNA in the cells of two individual pugs differ. Likewise, the sequences of DNA in you and a sibling differ (unless your sibling is an identical twin), as do those between you and an unrelated individual. However, the DNA sequences of two related individuals are more similar than the sequences of two unrelated individuals, and these similarities in sequence can be observed in various ways. This is the principle behind DNA fingerprinting, which is a method used to determine whether two DNA samples came from related (or the same) individuals or unrelated individuals.

1156 Chapter 20 | Organic Chemistry Figure 20.18 DNA is an organic molecule and the genetic material for all living organisms. (a) DNA is a double helix consisting of two single DNA strands hydrogen bonded together at each nitrogenous base. (b) This detail shows the hydrogen bonding (dotted lines) between nitrogenous bases on each DNA strand and the way in which each nucleotide is joined to the next, forming a backbone of sugars and phosphate groups along each strand. (c) This detail shows the structure of one of the four nucleotides that makes up the DNA polymer. Each nucleotide consists of a nitrogenous base (a double-ring molecule, in this case), a five-carbon sugar (deoxyribose), and a phosphate group. Using similarities in sequences, technicians can determine whether a man is the father of a child (the identity of the mother is rarely in doubt, except in the case of an adopted child and a potential birth mother). Likewise, forensic geneticists can determine whether a crime scene sample of human tissue, such as blood or skin cells, contains DNA that matches exactly the DNA of a suspect. https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

Like ammonia, amines are weak bases due to the lone pair of electrons on their nitrogen atoms: The basicity of an amine’s nitrogen atom plays an important role in much of the compound’s chemistry. Amine functional groups are found in a wide variety of compounds, including natural and synthetic dyes, polymers, vitamins, and medications such as penicillin and codeine. They are also found in many molecules essential to life, such as amino acids, hormones, neurotransmitters, and DNA. How Sciences Interconnect Addictive Alkaloids Since ancient times, plants have been used for medicinal purposes. One class of substances, called alkaloids, found in many of these plants has been isolated and found to contain cyclic molecules with an amine functional H3O+ group. These amines are bases. They can react with in a dilute acid to form an ammonium salt, and this property is used to extract them from the plant: Cl−⟶⎡ ⎤ O+ NH+ ⎦Cl−+ R3 N + H3 + ⎣R3 H2 O The name alkaloid means “like an alkali.” Thus, an alkaloid reacts with acid. The free compound can be recovered after extraction by reaction with a base: ⎡ ⎤ NH+ ⎦Cl−+ OH−⟶R3 Cl− ⎣R3 N + H2 O + The structures of many naturally occurring alkaloids have profound physiological and psychotropic effects in humans. Examples of these drugs include nicotine, morphine, codeine, and heroin. The plant produces these substances, collectively called secondary plant compounds, as chemical defenses against the numerous pests that attempt to feed on the plant:

The solid wedges indicate bonds that extend out of the page. The dashed wedges indicate bonds that extend into the page. Notice that small changes to a part of the molecule change the properties of morphine, codeine, and heroin. Morphine, a strong narcotic used to relieve pain, contains two hydroxyl functional groups, located at the bottom of the molecule in this structural formula. Changing one of these hydroxyl groups to a methyl ether group forms codeine, a less potent drug used as a local anesthetic. If both hydroxyl groups are converted to esters of acetic acid, the powerfully addictive drug heroin results (Figure 20.19). https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

(credit: Karen Roe) Amides are molecules that contain nitrogen atoms connected to the carbon atom of a carbonyl group. Like amines, various nomenclature rules may be used to name amides, but all include use of the class-specific suffix -amide: Amides can be produced when carboxylic acids react with amines or ammonia in a process called amidation. A water molecule is eliminated from the reaction, and the amide is formed from the remaining pieces of the carboxylic acid and the amine (note the similarity to formation of an ester from a carboxylic acid and an alcohol discussed in the previous section): The reaction between amines and carboxylic acids to form amides is biologically important. It is through this reaction that amino acids (molecules containing both amine and carboxylic acid substituents) link together in a polymer to form proteins. How Sciences Interconnect

1160 Chapter 20 | Organic Chemistry Proteins and Enzymes Proteins are large biological molecules made up of long chains of smaller molecules called amino acids. Organisms rely on proteins for a variety of functions—proteins transport molecules across cell membranes, replicate DNA, and catalyze metabolic reactions, to name only a few of their functions. The properties of proteins are functions of the combination of amino acids that compose them and can vary greatly. Interactions between amino acid sequences in the chains of proteins result in the folding of the chain into specific, three- dimensional structures that determine the protein’s activity. Amino acids are organic molecules that contain an amine functional group (–NH2), a carboxylic acid functional group (–COOH), and a side chain (that is specific to each individual amino acid). Most living things build proteins from the same 20 different amino acids. Amino acids connect by the formation of a peptide bond, which is a covalent bond formed between two amino acids when the carboxylic acid group of one amino acid reacts with the amine group of the other amino acid. The formation of the bond results in the production of a molecule of water (in general, reactions that result in the production of water when two other molecules combine are referred to as condensation reactions). The resulting bond—between the carbonyl group carbon atom and the amine nitrogen atom is called a peptide link or peptide bond. Since each of the original amino acids has an unreacted group (one has an unreacted amine and the other an unreacted carboxylic acid), more peptide bonds can form to other amino acids, extending the structure. (Figure 20.20) A chain of connected amino acids is called a polypeptide. Proteins contain at least one long polypeptide chain. Figure 20.20 This condensation reaction forms a dipeptide from two amino acids and leads to the formation of water. Enzymes are large biological molecules, mostly composed of proteins, which are responsible for the thousands of metabolic processes that occur in living organisms. Enzymes are highly specific catalysts; they speed up the rates of certain reactions. Enzymes function by lowering the activation energy of the reaction they are catalyzing, which can dramatically increase the rate of the reaction. Most reactions catalyzed by enzymes have rates that are millions of times faster than the noncatalyzed version. Like all catalysts, enzymes are not consumed during the reactions that they catalyze. Enzymes do differ from other catalysts in how specific they are for their substrates (the molecules that an enzyme will convert into a different product). Each enzyme is only capable of speeding up one or a few very specific reactions or types of reactions. Since the function of enzymes is so specific, the lack or malfunctioning of an enzyme can lead to serious health consequences. https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

Chapter 20 | Organic Chemistry 1161 One disease that is the result of an enzyme malfunction is phenylketonuria. In this disease, the enzyme that catalyzes the first step in the degradation of the amino acid phenylalanine is not functional (Figure 20.21). Untreated, this can lead to an accumulation of phenylalanine, which can lead to intellectual disabilities. Figure 20.21 A computer rendering shows the three-dimensional structure of the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase. In the disease phenylketonuria, a defect in the shape of phenylalanine hydroxylase causes it to lose its function in breaking down phenylalanine. Chemistry in Everyday Life Kevlar Kevlar (Figure 20.22) is a synthetic polymer made from two monomers 1,4-phenylene-diamine and terephthaloyl chloride (Kevlar is a registered trademark of DuPont). Kevlar’s first commercial use was as a replacement for steel in racing tires. Kevlar is typically spun into ropes or fibers. The material has a high tensile strength-to-weight ratio (it is about 5 times stronger than an equal weight of steel), making it useful for many applications from bicycle tires to sails to body armor. 

--- Page 1170 ---
1162 Chapter 20 | Organic Chemistry Figure 20.22 This illustration shows the formula for polymeric Kevlar. The material owes much of its strength to hydrogen bonds between polymer chains (refer back to the chapter on intermolecular interactions). These bonds form between the carbonyl group oxygen atom (which has a partial negative charge due to oxygen’s electronegativity) on one monomer and the partially positively charged hydrogen atom in the N–H bond of an adjacent monomer in the polymer structure (see dashed line in Figure 20.23). There is additional strength derived from the interaction between the unhybridized p orbitals in the six- membered rings, called aromatic stacking. Figure 20.23 The diagram shows the polymer structure of Kevlar, with hydrogen bonds between polymer chains represented by dotted lines. Kevlar may be best known as a component of body armor, combat helmets, and face masks. Since the 1980s, the US military has used Kevlar as a component of the PASGT (personal armor system for ground troops) helmet and vest. Kevlar is also used to protect armored fighting vehicles and aircraft carriers.

The chemistry of these compounds is called organic chemistry. Hydrocarbons are organic compounds composed of only carbon and hydrogen. The alkanes are saturated hydrocarbons—that is, hydrocarbons that contain only single bonds. Alkenes contain one or more carbon-carbon double bonds. Alkynes contain one or more carbon-carbon triple bonds. Aromatic hydrocarbons contain ring structures with delocalized π electron systems.

1166 Chapter 20 | Organic Chemistry 20.2 Alcohols and Ethers Many organic compounds that are not hydrocarbons can be thought of as derivatives of hydrocarbons. A hydrocarbon derivative can be formed by replacing one or more hydrogen atoms of a hydrocarbon by a functional group, which contains at least one atom of an element other than carbon or hydrogen. The properties of hydrocarbon derivatives are determined largely by the functional group. The –OH group is the functional group of an alcohol. The –R–O–R– group is the functional group of an ether. 20.3 Aldehydes, Ketones, Carboxylic Acids, and Esters Functional groups related to the carbonyl group include the –CHO group of an aldehyde, the –CO– group of a ketone, the –CO2H group of a carboxylic acid, and the –CO2R group of an ester. The carbonyl group, a carbon-oxygen double bond, is the key structure in these classes of organic molecules: Aldehydes contain at least one hydrogen atom attached to the carbonyl carbon atom, ketones contain two carbon groups attached to the carbonyl carbon atom, carboxylic acids contain a hydroxyl group attached to the carbonyl carbon atom, and esters contain an oxygen atom attached to another carbon group connected to the carbonyl carbon atom. All of these compounds contain oxidized carbon atoms relative to the carbon atom of an alcohol group. 20.4 Amines and Amides The addition of nitrogen into an organic framework leads to two families of molecules. Compounds containing a nitrogen atom bonded in a hydrocarbon framework are classified as amines. Compounds that have a nitrogen atom bonded to one side of a carbonyl group are classified as amides. Amines are a basic functional group. Amines and carboxylic acids can combine in a condensation reaction to form amides. Exercises 20.1 Hydrocarbons 1.

Nuclear structure, the numbers of protons and neutrons within the nuclei of the atoms involved, remains unchanged during chemical reactions. This chapter will introduce the topic of nuclear chemistry, which began with the discovery of radioactivity in 1896 by French physicist Antoine Becquerel and has become increasingly important during the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, providing the basis for various technologies related to energy, medicine, geology, and many other areas.

1176 Chapter 21 | Nuclear Chemistry 21.1 Nuclear Structure and Stability By the end of this section, you will be able to: Describe nuclear structure in terms of protons, neutrons, and electrons • Calculate mass defect and binding energy for nuclei • Explain trends in the relative stability of nuclei • Nuclear chemistry is the study of reactions that involve changes in nuclear structure. The chapter on atoms, molecules, and ions introduced the basic idea of nuclear structure, that the nucleus of an atom is composed of protons 1 H, and, with the exception of neutrons. Recall that the number of protons in the nucleus is called the atomic 1 number (Z) of the element, and the sum of the number of protons and the number of neutrons is the mass number (A). Atoms with the same atomic number but different mass numbers are isotopes of the same element. When referring to AX, a single type of nucleus, we often use the term nuclide and identify it by the notation where X is the symbol Z C⎞ 14 ⎠. for the element, A is the mass number, and Z is the atomic number (for example, Often a nuclide is referenced 6 14 C by the name of the element followed by a hyphen and the mass number. For example, is called “carbon-14.” 6 Protons and neutrons, collectively called nucleons, are packed together tightly in a nucleus. With a radius of about 10−15 10−10 meters, a nucleus is quite small compared to the radius of the entire atom, which is about meters. Nuclei 1014 × are extremely dense compared to bulk matter, averaging 1.8 grams per cubic centimeter. For example, water has a density of 1 gram per cubic centimeter, and iridium, one of the densest elements known, has a density of 22.6 g/cm3. If the earth’s density were equal to the average nuclear density, the earth’s radius would be only about 200 106 × Example 21.1 meters (earth’s actual radius is approximately 6.4 meters, 30,000 times larger). demonstrates just how great nuclear densities can be in the natural world. Example 21.1 Density of a Neutron Star Neutron stars form when the core of a very massive star undergoes gravitational collapse, causing the star’s outer layers to explode in a supernova. Composed almost completely of neutrons, they are the densest- known stars in the universe, with densities comparable to the average density of an atomic nucleus. A M☉= neutron star in a faraway galaxy has a mass equal to 2.4 solar masses (1 solar mass = mass of the 1030 × sun = 1.99 kg) and a diameter of 26 km. (a) What is the density of this neutron star? (b) How does this neutron star’s density compare to the density of a uranium nucleus, which has a diameter 10–15 of about 15 fm (1 fm = m)?

The neutron star is 5.7 times denser than the hydrogen nucleus. To hold positively charged protons together in the very small volume of a nucleus requires very strong attractive forces because the positively charged protons repel one another strongly at such short distances. The force of attraction that holds the nucleus together is the strong nuclear force. (The strong force is one of the four fundamental forces that are known to exist. The others are the electromagnetic force, the gravitational force, and the nuclear weak force.) This force acts between protons, between neutrons, and between protons and neutrons. It is very different from the electrostatic force that holds negatively charged electrons around a positively charged nucleus (the attraction 10−15 between opposite charges). Over distances less than meters and within the nucleus, the strong nuclear force is much stronger than electrostatic repulsions between protons; over larger distances and outside the nucleus, it is essentially nonexistent. Link to Learning Visit this website (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/16fourfund) for more information about the four fundamental forces. Nuclear Binding Energy As a simple example of the energy associated with the strong nuclear force, consider the helium atom composed of two protons, two neutrons, and two electrons. The total mass of these six subatomic particles may be calculated as: (2 amu) (2 amu) (2 amu) × 1.0073 + × 1.0087 + × 0.00055 = 4.0331 amu protons neutrons electrons 4 He However, mass spectrometric measurements reveal that the mass of an atom is 4.0026 amu, less than the 2 combined masses of its six constituent subatomic particles. This difference between the calculated and experimentally measured masses is known as the mass defect of the atom. In the case of helium, the mass defect indicates a “loss” 

--- Page 1186 ---
1178 Chapter 21 | Nuclear Chemistry in mass of 4.0331 amu – 4.0026 amu = 0.0305 amu. The loss in mass accompanying the formation of an atom from protons, neutrons, and electrons is due to the conversion of that mass into energy that is evolved as the atom forms. The nuclear binding energy is the energy produced when the atoms’ nucleons are bound together; this is also the energy needed to break a nucleus into its constituent protons and neutrons. In comparison to chemical bond energies, nuclear binding energies are vastly greater, as we will learn in this section. Consequently, the energy changes associated with nuclear reactions are vastly greater than are those for chemical reactions. The conversion between mass and energy is most identifiably represented by the mass-energy equivalence equation as stated by Albert Einstein: mc2 E = where E is energy, m is mass of the matter being converted, and c is the speed of light in a vacuum. This equation can be used to find the amount of energy that results when matter is converted into energy. Using this mass-energy equivalence equation, the nuclear binding energy of a nucleus may be calculated from its mass defect, as demonstrated Example 21.2. in A variety of units are commonly used for nuclear binding energies, including electron volts (eV), with 1 eV equaling the amount of energy necessary to the move the charge of an electron across an electric potential 10–19 × J. difference of 1 volt, making 1 eV = 1.602 Example 21.2 Calculation of Nuclear Binding Energy 4 He Determine the binding energy for the nuclide in: 2 (a) joules per mole of nuclei (b) joules per nucleus (c) MeV per nucleus Solution 4 He The mass defect for a nucleus is 0.0305 amu, as shown previously. Determine the binding energy in 2 joules per nuclide using the mass-energy equivalence equation. To accommodate the requested energy units, m2/s2). the mass defect must be expressed in kilograms (recall that 1 J = 1 kg (a) First, express the mass defect in g/mol. This is easily done considering the numerical equivalence of atomic mass (amu) and molar mass (g/mol) that results from the definitions of the amu and mole units (refer to the previous discussion in the chapter on atoms, molecules, and ions if needed). The mass defect is therefore 0.0305 g/mol. To accommodate the units of the other terms in the mass-energy equation, the mass m2/s2. must be expressed in kg, since 1 J = 1 kg Converting grams into kilograms yields a mass defect of 10–5 × 3.05 kg/mol.

As described in the chapter on thermochemistry, the most energetic chemical reactions exhibit enthalpies on the order of thousands (10–9 of kJ/mol, which is equivalent to mass differences in the nanogram range g). On the other hand, nuclear binding energies are typically on the order of billions of kJ/mol, corresponding to mass differences in the milligram range (10–3 g). Nuclear Stability A nucleus is stable if it cannot be transformed into another configuration without adding energy from the outside. Of the thousands of nuclides that exist, about 250 are stable. A plot of the number of neutrons versus the number of protons for stable nuclei reveals that the stable isotopes fall into a narrow band. This region is known as the band Figure 21.2 of stability (also called the belt, zone, or valley of stability). The straight line in represents nuclei that have a 1:1 ratio of protons to neutrons (n:p ratio). Note that the lighter stable nuclei, in general, have equal numbers of protons and neutrons. For example, nitrogen-14 has seven protons and seven neutrons. Heavier stable nuclei, however, have increasingly more neutrons than protons. For example: iron-56 has 30 neutrons and 26 protons, an n:p ratio of 1.15, whereas the stable nuclide lead-207 has 125 neutrons and 82 protons, an n:p ratio equal to 1.52. This is because larger nuclei have more proton-proton repulsions, and require larger numbers of neutrons to provide compensating strong forces to overcome these electrostatic repulsions and hold the nucleus together.

The stable nuclides are indicated in blue, and the unstable nuclides are indicated in green. Note that all isotopes of elements with atomic numbers greater than 83 are unstable. The solid line is the line where n = Z. The nuclei that are to the left or to the right of the band of stability are unstable and exhibit radioactivity. They change spontaneously (decay) into other nuclei that are either in, or closer to, the band of stability. These nuclear decay reactions convert one unstable isotope (or radioisotope) into another, more stable, isotope. We will discuss the nature and products of this radioactive decay in subsequent sections of this chapter. Several observations may be made regarding the relationship between the stability of a nucleus and its structure. Table 21.1). Nuclei with even numbers of protons, neutrons, or both are more likely to be stable (see Nuclei with https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

Chapter 21 | Nuclear Chemistry 1181 certain numbers of nucleons, known as magic numbers, are stable against nuclear decay. These numbers of protons or neutrons (2, 8, 20, 28, 50, 82, and 126) make complete shells in the nucleus. These are similar in concept to the stable electron shells observed for the noble gases. Nuclei that have magic numbers of both protons and neutrons, 16 40 208 4 He, O, Ca, Pb, and are called “double magic” and are particularly stable. These trends in such as 2 8 20 82 nuclear stability may be rationalized by considering a quantum mechanical model of nuclear energy states analogous to that used to describe electronic states earlier in this textbook. The details of this model are beyond the scope of this chapter.

For instance, we saw in that the binding 4 4 He He nucleus is 28.4 MeV. The binding energy per nucleon for a nucleus is therefore: energy for a 2 2 28.4 MeV = 7.10 MeV/nucleon 4 nucleons Example 21.3, In we learn how to calculate the binding energy per nucleon of a nuclide on the curve shown in Figure 21.3.

To describe a nuclear reaction, we use an equation that identifies the nuclides involved in the reaction, their mass numbers and atomic numbers, and the other particles involved in the reaction.

1184 Chapter 21 | Nuclear Chemistry Figure 21.4 Although many species are encountered in nuclear reactions, this table summarizes the names, symbols, representations, and descriptions of the most common of these. Note that positrons are exactly like electrons, except they have the opposite charge. They are the most common example of antimatter, particles with the same mass but the opposite state of another property (for example, charge) than ordinary matter. When antimatter encounters ordinary matter, both are annihilated and their mass is converted into energy in the form of gamma rays (γ)—and other much smaller subnuclear particles, which are beyond the mc2, scope of this chapter—according to the mass-energy equivalence equation E = seen in the preceding section. For example, when a positron and an electron collide, both are annihilated and two gamma ray photons are created: 0 0 e + e ⟶γ + γ −1 +1 As seen in the chapter discussing light and electromagnetic radiation, gamma rays compose short wavelength, high- energy electromagnetic radiation and are (much) more energetic than better-known X-rays that can behave as particles in the wave-particle duality sense. Gamma rays are produced when a nucleus undergoes a transition from a higher to a lower energy state, similar to how a photon is produced by an electronic transition from a higher to a lower energy level. Due to the much larger energy differences between nuclear energy shells, gamma rays emanating from a nucleus have energies that are typically millions of times larger than electromagnetic radiation emanating from electronic transitions. Balancing Nuclear Reactions A balanced chemical reaction equation reflects the fact that during a chemical reaction, bonds break and form, and atoms are rearranged, but the total numbers of atoms of each element are conserved and do not change. A balanced nuclear reaction equation indicates that there is a rearrangement during a nuclear reaction, but of subatomic particles rather than atoms. Nuclear reactions also follow conservation laws, and they are balanced in two ways: The sum of the mass numbers of the reactants equals the sum of the mass numbers of the products. 1. The sum of the charges of the reactants equals the sum of the charges of the products. 2. https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

Among them were Marie Curie (the first woman to win a Nobel Prize, and the only person to win two Nobel Prizes in different sciences—chemistry and physics), who was the first to coin the term “radioactivity,” and Ernest Rutherford (of gold foil experiment fame), who investigated and named three of the most common types of radiation. During the beginning of the twentieth century, many radioactive substances were discovered, the properties of radiation were investigated and quantified, and a solid understanding of radiation and nuclear decay was developed. The spontaneous change of an unstable nuclide into another is radioactive decay. The unstable nuclide is called the parent nuclide; the nuclide that results from the decay is known as the daughter nuclide. The daughter nuclide may be stable, or it may decay itself. The radiation produced during radioactive decay is such that the daughter nuclide lies closer to the band of stability than the parent nuclide, so the location of a nuclide relative to the band of stability (Figure 21.5). can serve as a guide to the kind of decay it will undergo Figure 21.5 A nucleus of uranium-238 (the parent nuclide) undergoes α decay to form thorium-234 (the daughter nuclide).

Types of Radioactive Decay (Figure 21.6) Ernest Rutherford’s experiments involving the interaction of radiation with a magnetic or electric field helped him determine that one type of radiation consisted of positively charged and relatively massive α particles; a second type was made up of negatively charged and much less massive β particles; and a third was uncharged electromagnetic waves, γ rays. We now know that α particles are high-energy helium nuclei, β particles are high- energy electrons, and γ radiation compose high-energy electromagnetic radiation. We classify different types of radioactive decay by the radiation produced. Figure 21.6 Alpha particles, which are attracted to the negative plate and deflected by a relatively small amount, must be positively charged and relatively massive. Beta particles, which are attracted to the positive plate and deflected a relatively large amount, must be negatively charged and relatively light. Gamma rays, which are unaffected by the electric field, must be uncharged. Alpha (α) decay is the emission of an α particle from the nucleus. For example, polonium-210 undergoes α decay: 210 206 210 206 4 4 Po ⟶2 He + Pb or Po ⟶2 α + Pb 84 82 84 82 Alpha decay occurs primarily in heavy nuclei (A > 200, Z > 83). Because the loss of an α particle gives a daughter nuclide with a mass number four units smaller and an atomic number two units smaller than those of the parent nuclide, the daughter nuclide has a larger n:p ratio than the parent nuclide. If the parent nuclide undergoing α decay Figure 21.2), lies below the band of stability (refer to the daughter nuclide will lie closer to the band. Beta (β) decay is the emission of an electron from a nucleus. Iodine-131 is an example of a nuclide that undergoes β decay: 131 0 131 131 0 131 I ⟶-1 e + X or I ⟶-1 β + Xe 53 54 53 54 Beta decay, which can be thought of as the conversion of a neutron into a proton and a β particle, is observed in nuclides with a large n:p ratio. The beta particle (electron) emitted is from the atomic nucleus and is not one of the electrons surrounding the nucleus. Such nuclei lie above the band of stability. Emission of an electron does not change the mass number of the nuclide but does increase the number of its protons and decrease the number of its neutrons.

1188 Chapter 21 | Nuclear Chemistry Consequently, the n:p ratio is decreased, and the daughter nuclide lies closer to the band of stability than did the parent nuclide. Gamma emission (γ emission) is observed when a nuclide is formed in an excited state and then decays to its ground state with the emission of a γ ray, a quantum of high-energy electromagnetic radiation. The presence of a nucleus in an excited state is often indicated by an asterisk (*). Cobalt-60 emits γ radiation and is used in many applications including cancer treatment: 60 0 60 Co* ⟶0 γ + Co 27 27 There is no change in mass number or atomic number during the emission of a γ ray unless the γ emission accompanies one of the other modes of decay. (β+ Positron emission decay) is the emission of a positron from the nucleus. Oxygen-15 is an example of a nuclide that undergoes positron emission: 15 0 15 15 0 15 O ⟶+1 e + N or O ⟶+1 β + N 7 7 8 8 Positron emission is observed for nuclides in which the n:p ratio is low. These nuclides lie below the band of stability. Positron decay is the conversion of a proton into a neutron with the emission of a positron. The n:p ratio increases, and the daughter nuclide lies closer to the band of stability than did the parent nuclide. Electron capture occurs when one of the inner electrons in an atom is captured by the atom’s nucleus. For example, potassium-40 undergoes electron capture: 40 0 40 K + e ⟶18 Ar 19 -1 Electron capture occurs when an inner shell electron combines with a proton and is converted into a neutron. The loss of an inner shell electron leaves a vacancy that will be filled by one of the outer electrons. As the outer electron drops into the vacancy, it will emit energy. In most cases, the energy emitted will be in the form of an X-ray. Like positron emission, electron capture occurs for “proton-rich” nuclei that lie below the band of stability. Electron capture has the same effect on the nucleus as does positron emission: The atomic number is decreased by one and the mass number does not change. This increases the n:p ratio, and the daughter nuclide lies closer to the band of stability than did the parent nuclide. Whether electron capture or positron emission occurs is difficult to predict. The choice is primarily due to kinetic factors, with the one requiring the smaller activation energy being the one more likely to occur.

Chemistry in Everyday Life PET Scan Positron emission tomography (PET) scans use radiation to diagnose and track health conditions and monitor medical treatments by revealing how parts of a patient’s body function (Figure 21.8). To perform a PET scan, a positron-emitting radioisotope is produced in a cyclotron and then attached to a substance that is used by the part of the body being investigated. This “tagged” compound, or radiotracer, is then put into the patient (injected via IV or breathed in as a gas), and how it is used by the tissue reveals how that organ or other area of the body functions.

This energy is detected by the scanner and converted into a detailed, three-dimensional, color image that shows how that part of the patient’s body functions. Different levels of gamma radiation produce different amounts of brightness and colors in the image, which can then be interpreted by a radiologist to reveal what is going on. PET scans can detect heart damage and heart disease, help diagnose Alzheimer’s disease, indicate the part of a brain that is affected by epilepsy, reveal cancer, show what stage it is, and how much it has spread, and whether treatments are effective. Unlike magnetic resonance imaging and X-rays, which only show how something looks, the big advantage of PET scans is that they show how something functions. PET scans are now usually performed in conjunction with a computed tomography scan. Radioactive Decay Series The naturally occurring radioactive isotopes of the heaviest elements fall into chains of successive disintegrations, or decays, and all the species in one chain constitute a radioactive family, or radioactive decay series. Three of these series include most of the naturally radioactive elements of the periodic table. They are the uranium series, the actinide series, and the thorium series. The neptunium series is a fourth series, which is no longer significant on the earth because of the short half-lives of the species involved. Each series is characterized by a parent (first member) that has a long half-life and a series of daughter nuclides that ultimately lead to a stable end-product—that is, a nuclide on the (Figure 21.9). band of stability In all three series, the end-product is a stable isotope of lead. The neptunium series, previously thought to terminate with bismuth-209, terminates with thallium-205. https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

Chapter 21 | Nuclear Chemistry 1191 Figure 21.9 Uranium-238 undergoes a radioactive decay series consisting of 14 separate steps before producing stable lead-206. This series consists of eight α decays and six β decays. Radioactive Half-Lives Radioactive decay follows first-order kinetics. Since first-order reactions have already been covered in detail in the kinetics chapter, we will now apply those concepts to nuclear decay reactions. Each radioactive nuclide has a characteristic, constant half-life (t1/2), the time required for half of the atoms in a sample to decay. An isotope’s half- life allows us to determine how long a sample of a useful isotope will be available, and how long a sample of an undesirable or dangerous isotope must be stored before it decays to a low-enough radiation level that is no longer a problem. (Figure For example, cobalt-60, an isotope that emits gamma rays used to treat cancer, has a half-life of 5.27 years 60 Co 21.10). In a given cobalt-60 source, since half of the nuclei decay every 5.27 years, both the amount of 27 material and the intensity of the radiation emitted is cut in half every 5.27 years. (Note that for a given substance, the intensity of radiation that it produces is directly proportional to the rate of decay of the substance and the amount of the substance.) This is as expected for a process following first-order kinetics. Thus, a cobalt-60 source that is used for cancer treatment must be replaced regularly to continue to be effective.

1192 Chapter 21 | Nuclear Chemistry Figure 21.10 For cobalt-60, which has a half-life of 5.27 years, 50% remains after 5.27 years (one half-life), 25% remains after 10.54 years (two half-lives), 12.5% remains after 15.81 years (three half-lives), and so on. Since nuclear decay follows first-order kinetics, we can adapt the mathematical relationships used for first-order chemical reactions. We generally substitute the number of nuclei, N, for the concentration. If the rate is stated in nuclear decays per second, we refer to it as the activity of the radioactive sample. The rate for radioactive decay is: decay rate = λN with λ = the decay constant for the particular radioisotope The decay constant, λ, which is the same as a rate constant discussed in the kinetics chapter.

1194 Chapter 21 | Nuclear Chemistry Radiometric Dating Several radioisotopes have half-lives and other properties that make them useful for purposes of “dating” the origin of objects such as archaeological artifacts, formerly living organisms, or geological formations. This process is radiometric dating and has been responsible for many breakthrough scientific discoveries about the geological history of the earth, the evolution of life, and the history of human civilization. We will explore some of the most common types of radioactive dating and how the particular isotopes work for each type. Radioactive Dating Using Carbon-14 The radioactivity of carbon-14 provides a method for dating objects that were a part of a living organism. This method of radiometric dating, which is also called radiocarbon dating or carbon-14 dating, is accurate for dating carbon-containing substances that are up to about 30,000 years old, and can provide reasonably accurate dates up to a maximum of about 50,000 years old. 12 C, Naturally occurring carbon consists of three isotopes: which constitutes about 99% of the carbon on earth; 6 13 14 C, C. about 1% of the total; and trace amounts of Carbon-14 forms in the upper atmosphere by the reaction of 6 6 nitrogen atoms with neutrons from cosmic rays in space: 14 1 14 1 N + n ⟶ C + H 7 0 1 6 14 12 CO2 CO2 All isotopes of carbon react with oxygen to produce CO2 molecules. The ratio of to depends on the 6 6 14 12 14 CO CO CO ratio of to in the atmosphere. The natural abundance of in the atmosphere is approximately 1 6 6 6 part per trillion; until recently, this has generally been constant over time, as seen is gas samples found trapped in ice. 14 14 12 C CO2 CO2 The incorporation of and into plants is a regular part of the photosynthesis process, which means 6 6 6 14 12 14 12 C: C C: C that the ratio found in a living plant is the same as the ratio in the atmosphere. But when the 6 6 6 6 12 C plant dies, it no longer traps carbon through photosynthesis. Because is a stable isotope and does not undergo 6 radioactive decay, its concentration in the plant does not change. However, carbon-14 decays by β emission with a half-life of 5730 years: 0 14 12 C ⟶ N + e 7 -1 6 14 12 C: C Thus, the ratio gradually decreases after the plant dies. The decrease in the ratio with time provides a 6 6 Figure 21.11 measure of the time that has elapsed since the death of the plant (or other organism that ate the plant). visually depicts this process. https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

Chapter 21 | Nuclear Chemistry 1195 Figure 21.11 Along with stable carbon-12, radioactive carbon-14 is taken in by plants and animals, and remains at a constant level within them while they are alive. After death, the C-14 decays and the C-14:C-12 ratio in the remains decreases. Comparing this ratio to the C-14:C-12 ratio in living organisms allows us to determine how long ago the organism lived (and died). 14 14 12 C C: C For example, with the half-life of being 5730 years, if the ratio in a wooden object found in an 6 6 6 archaeological dig is half what it is in a living tree, this indicates that the wooden object is 5730 years old. Highly 14 12 C: C accurate determinations of ratios can be obtained from very small samples (as little as a milligram) by the 6 6 use of a mass spectrometer.

1196 Chapter 21 | Nuclear Chemistry A tiny piece of paper (produced from formerly living plant matter) taken from the Dead Sea Scrolls has an activity of 10.8 disintegrations per minute per gram of carbon. If the initial C-14 activity was 13.6 disintegrations/min/g of C, estimate the age of the Dead Sea Scrolls. Solution The rate of decay (number of disintegrations/minute/gram of carbon) is proportional to the amount of radioactive C-14 left in the paper, so we can substitute the rates for the amounts, N, in the relationship: ⎞ ⎛ ⎞ ⎛ Nt Ratet −1 −1 ⎠ ⎝ ⎠⟶t ⎝ t = ln = ln N0 Rate0 λ λ where the subscript 0 represents the time when the plants were cut to make the paper, and the subscript t represents the current time.

Check Your Learning More accurate dates of the reigns of ancient Egyptian pharaohs have been determined recently using plants that were preserved in their tombs. Samples of seeds and plant matter from King Tutankhamun’s tomb have a C-14 decay rate of 9.07 disintegrations/min/g of C. How long ago did King Tut’s reign come to an end? Answer: about 3350 years ago, or approximately 1340 BC 14 12 C: C ratio. The accuracy of a There have been some significant, well-documented changes to the 6 6 14 12 C: C straightforward application of this technique depends on the ratio in a living plant being the same now as 6 6 it was in an earlier era, but this is not always valid.

Chapter 21 | Nuclear Chemistry 1197 correction factors. With these correction factors, accurate dates can be determined. In general, radioactive dating only works for about 10 half-lives; therefore, the limit for carbon-14 dating is about 57,000 years. Radioactive Dating Using Nuclides Other than Carbon-14 Radioactive dating can also use other radioactive nuclides with longer half-lives to date older events. For example, uranium-238 (which decays in a series of steps into lead-206) can be used for establishing the age of rocks (and the approximate age of the oldest rocks on earth). Since U-238 has a half-life of 4.5 billion years, it takes that amount of time for half of the original U-238 to decay into Pb-206. In a sample of rock that does not contain appreciable amounts of Pb-208, the most abundant isotope of lead, we can assume that lead was not present when the rock was formed. Therefore, by measuring and analyzing the ratio of U-238:Pb-206, we can determine the age of the rock. This assumes that all of the lead-206 present came from the decay of uranium-238. If there is additional lead-206 present, which is indicated by the presence of other lead isotopes in the sample, it is necessary to make an adjustment. Potassium-argon dating uses a similar method. K-40 decays by positron emission and electron capture to form Ar-40 with a half-life of 1.25 billion years. If a rock sample is crushed and the amount of Ar-40 gas that escapes is measured, determination of the Ar-40:K-40 ratio yields the age of the rock. Other methods, such as rubidium-strontium dating (Rb-87 decays into Sr-87 with a half-life of 48.8 billion years), operate on the same principle. To estimate the lower limit for the earth’s age, scientists determine the age of various rocks and minerals, making the assumption that the earth is older than the oldest rocks and minerals in its crust. As of 2014, the oldest known rocks on earth are the Jack Hills zircons from Australia, found by uranium-lead dating to be almost 4.4 billion years old. Example 21.7 Radioactive Dating of Rocks 10–5 10–5 × × An igneous rock contains 9.58 g of U-238 and 2.51 g of Pb-206, and much, much smaller amounts of Pb-208. Determine the approximate time at which the rock formed. Solution The sample of rock contains very little Pb-208, the most common isotope of lead, so we can safely assume that all the Pb-206 in the rock was produced by the radioactive decay of U-238. When the rock formed, it contained all of the U-238 currently in it, plus some U-238 that has since undergone radioactive decay. The amount of U-238 currently in the rock is: ⎛ ⎞ ⎜1 ⎟= mol U 10−5 10−7 4.03 × mol U 9.58 × g U × ⎝ ⎠ 238 g U Because when one mole of U-238 decays, it produces one mole of Pb-206, the amount of U-238 that has undergone radioactive decay since the rock was formed is: ⎞ ⎛ ⎛ ⎞ ⎜1 mol Pb ⎟× 1 mol U 10−5 10−7 ⎝ ⎠= 2.51 × g Pb × 1.22 × mol U ⎠ ⎝ 1 mol Pb 206 g Pb The total amount of U-238 originally present in the rock is therefore: 10−7 10−7 10−7 4.03 × mol + 1.22 × mol = 5.25 × mol U The amount of time that has passed since the formation of the rock is given by: ⎛ ⎞ Nt −1 ⎝ ⎠ t = ln N0 λ with N0 representing the original amount of U-238 and Nt representing the present amount of U-238.

A slew of new discoveries in the 1930s and 1940s, along with World War II, combined to usher in the Nuclear Age in the mid-twentieth century. Science learned how to create new substances, and certain isotopes of certain elements were found to possess the capacity to produce unprecedented amounts of energy, with the potential to cause tremendous damage during war, as well as produce enormous amounts of power for society’s needs during peace. Synthesis of Nuclides Nuclear transmutation is the conversion of one nuclide into another. It can occur by the radioactive decay of a nucleus, or the reaction of a nucleus with another particle. The first manmade nucleus was produced in Ernest Rutherford’s laboratory in 1919 by a transmutation reaction, the bombardment of one type of nuclei with other nuclei or with neutrons. Rutherford bombarded nitrogen atoms with high-speed α particles from a natural radioactive isotope of radium and observed protons resulting from the reaction: 17 14 4 1 N + He ⟶ O + H 7 2 8 1 17 1 O H The and nuclei that are produced are stable, so no further (nuclear) changes occur. 8 1 To reach the kinetic energies necessary to produce transmutation reactions, devices called particle accelerators are used. These devices use magnetic and electric fields to increase the speeds of nuclear particles. In all accelerators, the particles move in a vacuum to avoid collisions with gas molecules.

Chemistry in Everyday Life CERN Particle Accelerator Located near Geneva, the CERN (“Conseil Européen pour la Recherche Nucléaire,” or European Council for Nuclear Research) Laboratory is the world’s premier center for the investigations of the fundamental particles that make up matter. It contains the 27-kilometer (17 mile) long, circular Large Hadron Collider (LHC), the largest particle accelerator in the world (Figure 21.13). In the LHC, particles are boosted to high energies and are then made to collide with each other or with stationary targets at nearly the speed of light. Superconducting electromagnets are used to produce a strong magnetic field that guides the particles around the ring. Specialized, purpose-built detectors observe and record the results of these collisions, which are then analyzed by CERN scientists using powerful computers.

1200 Chapter 21 | Nuclear Chemistry Prior to 1940, the heaviest-known element was uranium, whose atomic number is 92. Now, many artificial elements have been synthesized and isolated, including several on such a large scale that they have had a profound effect on society. One of these—element 93, neptunium (Np)—was first made in 1940 by McMillan and Abelson by bombarding uranium-238 with neutrons. The reaction creates unstable uranium-239, with a half-life of 23.5 minutes, which then decays into neptunium-239. Neptunium-239 is also radioactive, with a half-life of 2.36 days, and it decays into plutonium-239.

Some of the neutrons that are released during U-235 decay combine with U-238 nuclei to form uranium-239; this undergoes β decay to form neptunium-239, which in turn undergoes β decay to form plutonium-239 as illustrated in the preceding three equations. It is possible to summarize these equations as: β− β− 239 239 239 238 1 ⎯⎯⎯ → ⎯⎯⎯ → U U + n ⟶ Np Pu 92 0 92 93 94 Heavier isotopes of plutonium—Pu-240, Pu-241, and Pu-242—are also produced when lighter plutonium nuclei capture neutrons. Some of this highly radioactive plutonium is used to produce military weapons, and the rest presents a serious storage problem because they have half-lives from thousands to hundreds of thousands of years. Although they have not been prepared in the same quantity as plutonium, many other synthetic nuclei have been produced. Nuclear medicine has developed from the ability to convert atoms of one type into other types of atoms. Radioactive isotopes of several dozen elements are currently used for medical applications. The radiation produced by their decay is used to image or treat various organs or portions of the body, among other uses. The elements beyond element 92 (uranium) are called transuranium elements. As of this writing, 22 transuranium elements have been produced and officially recognized by IUPAC; several other elements have formation claims that Table 21.3. are waiting for approval.

This decomposition is called fission, the breaking of a large nucleus into smaller pieces. The breaking is rather random with the formation of a large number of different products. Fission usually does not occur naturally, but is induced by bombardment with neutrons. The first reported nuclear fission occurred in 1939 when three German scientists, Lise Meitner, Otto Hahn, and Fritz Strassman, bombarded uranium-235 atoms with slow-moving neutrons that split the U-238 nuclei into smaller fragments that consisted of several neutrons and elements near the middle of the periodic table. Since then, fission has been observed in many other isotopes, including most actinide isotopes that Figure 21.14. have an odd number of neutrons. A typical nuclear fission reaction is shown in Figure 21.14 When a slow neutron hits a fissionable U-235 nucleus, it is absorbed and forms an unstable U-236 nucleus. The U-236 nucleus then rapidly breaks apart into two smaller nuclei (in this case, Ba-141 and Kr-92) along with several neutrons (usually two or three), and releases a very large amount of energy. Among the products of Meitner, Hahn, and Strassman’s fission reaction were barium, krypton, lanthanum, and cerium, all of which have nuclei that are more stable than uranium-235. Since then, hundreds of different isotopes have been observed among the products of fissionable substances. A few of the many reactions that occur for U-235, Figure 21.15. and a graph showing the distribution of its fission products and their yields, are shown in Similar

1202 Chapter 21 | Nuclear Chemistry fission reactions have been observed with other uranium isotopes, as well as with a variety of other isotopes such as those of plutonium. Figure 21.15 (a) Nuclear fission of U-235 produces a range of fission products. (b) The larger fission products of U-235 are typically one isotope with a mass number around 85–105, and another isotope with a mass number that is about 50% larger, that is, about 130–150. Link to Learning View this link (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/16fission) to see a simulation of nuclear fission. A tremendous amount of energy is produced by the fission of heavy elements. For instance, when one mole of U-235 undergoes fission, the products weigh about 0.2 grams less than the reactants; this “lost” mass is converted into a very 1010 × large amount of energy, about 1.8 kJ per mole of U-235. Nuclear fission reactions produce incredibly large amounts of energy compared to chemical reactions. The fission of 1 kilogram of uranium-235, for example, produces about 2.5 million times as much energy as is produced by burning 1 kilogram of coal. As described earlier, when undergoing fission U-235 produces two “medium-sized” nuclei, and two or three neutrons. These neutrons may then cause the fission of other uranium-235 atoms, which in turn provide more neutrons that can Figure 21.16). cause fission of even more nuclei, and so on. If this occurs, we have a nuclear chain reaction (see On the other hand, if too many neutrons escape the bulk material without interacting with a nucleus, then no chain reaction will occur. https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at 

--- Page 1211 ---
Chapter 21 | Nuclear Chemistry 1203 Figure 21.16 The fission of a large nucleus, such as U-235, produces two or three neutrons, each of which is capable of causing fission of another nucleus by the reactions shown. If this process continues, a nuclear chain reaction occurs. Material that can sustain a nuclear fission chain reaction is said to be fissile or fissionable. (Technically, fissile material can undergo fission with neutrons of any energy, whereas fissionable material requires high-energy neutrons.) Nuclear fission becomes self-sustaining when the number of neutrons produced by fission equals or exceeds the number of neutrons absorbed by splitting nuclei plus the number that escape into the surroundings. The amount of a fissionable material that will support a self-sustaining chain reaction is a critical mass. An amount of fissionable material that cannot sustain a chain reaction is a subcritical mass. An amount of material in which there

1204 Chapter 21 | Nuclear Chemistry is an increasing rate of fission is known as a supercritical mass. The critical mass depends on the type of material: (Figure 21.17). its purity, the temperature, the shape of the sample, and how the neutron reactions are controlled Figure 21.17 (a) In a subcritical mass, the fissile material is too small and allows too many neutrons to escape the material, so a chain reaction does not occur. (b) In a critical mass, a large enough number of neutrons in the fissile material induce fission to create a chain reaction. 239 235 U Pu, (Figure 21.18) An atomic bomb contains several pounds of fissionable material, or a source of 92 94 neutrons, and an explosive device for compressing it quickly into a small volume. When fissionable material is in small pieces, the proportion of neutrons that escape through the relatively large surface area is great, and a chain reaction does not take place. When the small pieces of fissionable material are brought together quickly to form a body with a mass larger than the critical mass, the relative number of escaping neutrons decreases, and a chain reaction and explosion result. https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

Chapter 21 | Nuclear Chemistry 1205 Figure 21.18 (a) The nuclear fission bomb that destroyed Hiroshima on August 6, 1945, consisted of two subcritical masses of U-235, where conventional explosives were used to fire one of the subcritical masses into the other, creating the critical mass for the nuclear explosion. (b) The plutonium bomb that destroyed Nagasaki on August 12, 1945, consisted of a hollow sphere of plutonium that was rapidly compressed by conventional explosives. This led to a concentration of plutonium in the center that was greater than the critical mass necessary for the nuclear explosion. Fission Reactors Chain reactions of fissionable materials can be controlled and sustained without an explosion in a nuclear reactor (Figure 21.19). Any nuclear reactor that produces power via the fission of uranium or plutonium by bombardment with neutrons must have at least five components: nuclear fuel consisting of fissionable material, a nuclear moderator, reactor coolant, control rods, and a shield and containment system. We will discuss these components in greater detail later in the section. The reactor works by separating the fissionable nuclear material such that a critical mass cannot be formed, controlling both the flux and absorption of neutrons to allow shutting down the fission reactions. In a nuclear reactor used for the production of electricity, the energy released by fission reactions is trapped as thermal energy and used to boil water and produce steam. The steam is used to turn a turbine, which powers a generator for the production of electricity.

The domes are the containment structures for the nuclear reactors, and the brown building houses the turbine where electricity is generated. Ocean water is used for cooling. (b) The Diablo Canyon uses a pressurized water reactor, one of a few different fission reactor designs in use around the world, to produce electricity. Energy from the nuclear fission reactions in the core heats water in a closed, pressurized system. Heat from this system produces steam that drives a turbine, which in turn produces electricity.

Baird; credit b: modification of work by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission) Nuclear Fuels Nuclear fuel consists of a fissionable isotope, such as uranium-235, which must be present in sufficient quantity to provide a self-sustaining chain reaction. In the United States, uranium ores contain from 0.05–0.3% of the uranium oxide U3O8; the uranium in the ore is about 99.3% nonfissionable U-238 with only 0.7% fissionable U-235. Nuclear reactors require a fuel with a higher concentration of U-235 than is found in nature; it is normally enriched to have about 5% of uranium mass as U-235. At this concentration, it is not possible to achieve the supercritical mass necessary for a nuclear explosion. Uranium can be enriched by gaseous diffusion (the only method currently used in the US), using a gas centrifuge, or by laser separation. In the gaseous diffusion enrichment plant where U-235 fuel is prepared, UF6 (uranium hexafluoride) gas at low pressure moves through barriers that have holes just barely large enough for UF6 to pass through. The slightly 235UF6 238UF6 lighter molecules diffuse through the barrier slightly faster than the heavier molecules. This process 235UF6 is repeated through hundreds of barriers, gradually increasing the concentration of to the level needed by the nuclear reactor. The basis for this process, Graham’s law, is described in the chapter on gases. The enriched UF6 gas is collected, cooled until it solidifies, and then taken to a fabrication facility where it is made into fuel assemblies. Each fuel assembly consists of fuel rods that contain many thimble-sized, ceramic-encased, enriched uranium (usually UO2) fuel pellets. Modern nuclear reactors may contain as many as 10 million fuel pellets. The amount of energy in each of these pellets is equal to that in almost a ton of coal or 150 gallons of oil. Nuclear Moderators Figure 21.17). Neutrons produced by nuclear reactions move too fast to cause fission (refer back to They must first be slowed to be absorbed by the fuel and produce additional nuclear reactions. A nuclear moderator is a substance that slows the neutrons to a speed that is low enough to cause fission.

Modern reactors in the US exclusively use heavy water or light water (ordinary H2O), whereas some reactors in other countries use other materials, such as carbon dioxide, beryllium, or graphite. Reactor Coolants A nuclear reactor coolant is used to carry the heat produced by the fission reaction to an external boiler and turbine, where it is transformed into electricity. Two overlapping coolant loops are often used; this counteracts the transfer of radioactivity from the reactor to the primary coolant loop. All nuclear power plants in the US use water as a coolant. Other coolants include molten sodium, lead, a lead-bismuth mixture, or molten salts. Control Rods (Figure 21.20) Nuclear reactors use control rods to control the fission rate of the nuclear fuel by adjusting the number of slow neutrons present to keep the rate of the chain reaction at a safe level. Control rods are made of boron, cadmium, hafnium, or other elements that are able to absorb neutrons. Boron-10, for example, absorbs neutrons by a reaction that produces lithium-7 and alpha particles: 10 7 1 4 B + n ⟶3 Li + He 0 2 5 When control rod assemblies are inserted into the fuel element in the reactor core, they absorb a larger fraction of the slow neutrons, thereby slowing the rate of the fission reaction and decreasing the power produced. Conversely, if the control rods are removed, fewer neutrons are absorbed, and the fission rate and energy production increase. In an emergency, the chain reaction can be shut down by fully inserting all of the control rods into the nuclear core between the fuel rods.

Generalic, http://glossary.periodni.com/glossary.php?en=control+rod) Shield and Containment System During its operation, a nuclear reactor produces neutrons and other radiation. Even when shut down, the decay products are radioactive. In addition, an operating reactor is thermally very hot, and high pressures result from the circulation of water or another coolant through it. Thus, a reactor must withstand high temperatures and pressures, and must protect operating personnel from the radiation. Reactors are equipped with a containment system (or shield) that consists of three parts: The reactor vessel, a steel shell that is 3–20-centimeters thick and, with the moderator, absorbs much of the 1. radiation produced by the reactor A main shield of 1–3 meters of high-density concrete 2. A personnel shield of lighter materials that protects operators from γ rays and X-rays 3. In addition, reactors are often covered with a steel or concrete dome that is designed to contain any radioactive materials might be released by a reactor accident. https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

Chapter 21 | Nuclear Chemistry 1209 Link to Learning Click here to watch a 3-minute video (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/ 16nucreactors) from the Nuclear Energy Institute on how nuclear reactors work. Nuclear power plants are designed in such a way that they cannot form a supercritical mass of fissionable material and therefore cannot create a nuclear explosion. But as history has shown, failures of systems and safeguards can cause catastrophic accidents, including chemical explosions and nuclear meltdowns (damage to the reactor core from overheating). The following Chemistry in Everyday Life feature explores three infamous meltdown incidents. Chemistry in Everyday Life Nuclear Accidents The importance of cooling and containment are amply illustrated by three major accidents that occurred with the nuclear reactors at nuclear power generating stations in the United States (Three Mile Island), the former Soviet Union (Chernobyl), and Japan (Fukushima). In March 1979, the cooling system of the Unit 2 reactor at Three Mile Island Nuclear Generating Station in Pennsylvania failed, and the cooling water spilled from the reactor onto the floor of the containment building. After the pumps stopped, the reactors overheated due to the high radioactive decay heat produced in the first few days after the nuclear reactor shut down. The temperature of the core climbed to at least 2200 °C, and the upper portion of the core began to melt. In addition, the zirconium alloy cladding of the fuel rods began to react with steam and produced hydrogen: Zr(s) O(g) ⟶ZrO2(s) + 2H2(g) + 2H2 The hydrogen accumulated in the confinement building, and it was feared that there was danger of an explosion of the mixture of hydrogen and air in the building. Consequently, hydrogen gas and radioactive gases (primarily krypton and xenon) were vented from the building. Within a week, cooling water circulation was restored and the core began to cool. The plant was closed for nearly 10 years during the cleanup process. Although zero discharge of radioactive material is desirable, the discharge of radioactive krypton and xenon, such as occurred at the Three Mile Island plant, is among the most tolerable. These gases readily disperse in the atmosphere and thus do not produce highly radioactive areas. Moreover, they are noble gases and are not incorporated into plant and animal matter in the food chain. Effectively none of the heavy elements of the core of the reactor were released into the environment, and no cleanup of the area outside of the containment building was necessary (Figure 21.21).

1210 Chapter 21 | Nuclear Chemistry Figure 21.21 (a) In this 2010 photo of Three Mile Island, the remaining structures from the damaged Unit 2 reactor are seen on the left, whereas the separate Unit 1 reactor, unaffected by the accident, continues generating power to this day (right). (b) President Jimmy Carter visited the Unit 2 control room a few days after the accident in 1979. Another major nuclear accident involving a reactor occurred in April 1986, at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant in Ukraine, which was still a part of the former Soviet Union. While operating at low power during an unauthorized experiment with some of its safety devices shut off, one of the reactors at the plant became unstable. Its chain reaction became uncontrollable and increased to a level far beyond what the reactor was designed for. The steam pressure in the reactor rose to between 100 and 500 times the full power pressure and ruptured the reactor. Because the reactor was not enclosed in a containment building, a large amount of radioactive material spewed out, and additional fission products were released, as the graphite (carbon) moderator of the core ignited and burned. The fire was controlled, but over 200 plant workers and firefighters developed acute radiation sickness and at least 32 soon died from the effects of the radiation. It is predicted that about 4000 more deaths will occur among emergency workers and former Chernobyl residents from radiation-induced cancer and leukemia. The reactor has since been encapsulated in steel and concrete, a now-decaying structure known as the sarcophagus. Almost 30 years later, significant radiation problems still persist in the area, and Chernobyl largely remains a wasteland. In 2011, the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant in Japan was badly damaged by a 9.0-magnitude earthquake and resulting tsunami. Three reactors up and running at the time were shut down automatically, and emergency generators came online to power electronics and coolant systems. However, the tsunami quickly flooded the emergency generators and cut power to the pumps that circulated coolant water through the reactors. High-temperature steam in the reactors reacted with zirconium alloy to produce hydrogen gas. The gas escaped into the containment building, and the mixture of hydrogen and air exploded. Radioactive material was released from the containment vessels as the result of deliberate venting to reduce the hydrogen pressure, deliberate discharge of coolant water into the sea, and accidental or uncontrolled events. An evacuation zone around the damaged plant extended over 12.4 miles away, and an estimated 200,000 people were evacuated from the area. All 48 of Japan’s nuclear power plants were subsequently shut down, remaining shuttered as of December 2014. Since the disaster, public opinion has shifted from largely favoring to largely opposing increasing the use of nuclear power plants, and a restart of Japan’s atomic energy program is still stalled (Figure 21.22). https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

(credit a: modification of work by “Live Action Hero”/Flickr) The energy produced by a reactor fueled with enriched uranium results from the fission of uranium as well as from the fission of plutonium produced as the reactor operates. As discussed previously, the plutonium forms from the combination of neutrons and the uranium in the fuel. In any nuclear reactor, only about 0.1% of the mass of the fuel is converted into energy. The other 99.9% remains in the fuel rods as fission products and unused fuel. All of the fission products absorb neutrons, and after a period of several months to a few years, depending on the reactor, the fission products must be removed by changing the fuel rods. Otherwise, the concentration of these fission products would increase and absorb more neutrons until the reactor could no longer operate. Spent fuel rods contain a variety of products, consisting of unstable nuclei ranging in atomic number from 25 to 60, some transuranium elements, including plutonium and americium, and unreacted uranium isotopes. The unstable nuclei and the transuranium isotopes give the spent fuel a dangerously high level of radioactivity. The long-lived isotopes require thousands of years to decay to a safe level. The ultimate fate of the nuclear reactor as a significant source of energy in the United States probably rests on whether or not a politically and scientifically satisfactory technique for processing and storing the components of spent fuel rods can be developed.

Nuclear Fusion and Fusion Reactors The process of converting very light nuclei into heavier nuclei is also accompanied by the conversion of mass into large amounts of energy, a process called fusion. The principal source of energy in the sun is a net fusion reaction in which four hydrogen nuclei fuse and produce one helium nucleus and two positrons. This is a net reaction of a more complicated series of events: 

--- Page 1220 ---
1212 Chapter 21 | Nuclear Chemistry 0 1 4 41 H ⟶2 He + 2+1 A helium nucleus has a mass that is 0.7% less than that of four hydrogen nuclei; this lost mass is converted into 4 1011 × He kJ of energy per mole of produced. This is energy during the fusion. This reaction produces about 3.6 2 1010 × somewhat larger than the energy produced by the nuclear fission of one mole of U-235 (1.8 kJ), and over 3 million times larger than the energy produced by the (chemical) combustion of one mole of octane (5471 kJ). 3, 2 and a triton, undergo It has been determined that the nuclei of the heavy isotopes of hydrogen, a deuteron, 1 1 fusion at extremely high temperatures (thermonuclear fusion). They form a helium nucleus and a neutron: 3 2 4 1 H + H ⟶2 He + 20 n 1 1 109 × This change proceeds with a mass loss of 0.0188 amu, corresponding to the release of 1.69 kilojoules per mole 4 He of formed. The very high temperature is necessary to give the nuclei enough kinetic energy to overcome the 2 very strong repulsive forces resulting from the positive charges on their nuclei so they can collide. Useful fusion reactions require very high temperatures for their initiation—about 15,000,000 K or more. At these temperatures, all molecules dissociate into atoms, and the atoms ionize, forming plasma. These conditions occur in an extremely large number of locations throughout the universe—stars are powered by fusion. Humans have already figured out how to create temperatures high enough to achieve fusion on a large scale in thermonuclear weapons. A thermonuclear weapon such as a hydrogen bomb contains a nuclear fission bomb that, when exploded, gives off enough energy to produce the extremely high temperatures necessary for fusion to occur. Another much more beneficial way to create fusion reactions is in a fusion reactor, a nuclear reactor in which fusion reactions of light nuclei are controlled. Because no solid materials are stable at such high temperatures, mechanical devices cannot contain the plasma in which fusion reactions occur. Two techniques to contain plasma at the density and temperature necessary for a fusion reaction are currently the focus of intensive research efforts: containment by (Figure 21.23). large projects are working to a magnetic field and by the use of focused laser beams A number of attain one of the biggest goals in science: getting hydrogen fuel to ignite and produce more energy than the amount supplied to achieve the extremely high temperatures and pressures that are required for fusion. At the time of this writing, there are no self-sustaining fusion reactors operating in the world, although small-scale controlled fusion reactions have been run for very brief periods. https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

If we replace one (or more) atom(s) with radioisotope(s) in a compound, we can track them by monitoring their radioactive emissions. This type of compound is called a radioactive tracer (or radioactive label). Radioisotopes are used to follow the paths of biochemical reactions or to determine how a substance is distributed within an organism. Radioactive tracers are also used in many medical applications, including both diagnosis and treatment. They are used to measure engine wear, analyze the geological formation around oil wells, and much more. Appendix M), Radioisotopes have revolutionized medical practice (see where they are used extensively. Over 10 million nuclear medicine procedures and more than 100 million nuclear medicine tests are performed annually in the 99 (43 Tc) United States. Four typical examples of radioactive tracers used in medicine are technetium-99 , thallium-201 201 131 24 ( Tl) ( I) (11 Na) , iodine-131 , and sodium-24 . Damaged tissues in the heart, liver, and lungs absorb certain 81 53 compounds of technetium-99 preferentially. After it is injected, the location of the technetium compound, and hence (Figure the damaged tissue, can be determined by detecting the γ rays emitted by the Tc-99 isotope. Thallium-201 21.24) becomes concentrated in healthy heart tissue, so the two isotopes, Tc-99 and Tl-201, are used together to study heart tissue. Iodine-131 concentrates in the thyroid gland, the liver, and some parts of the brain. It can therefore be used to monitor goiter and treat thyroid conditions, such as Grave’s disease, as well as liver and brain tumors. Salt solutions containing compounds of sodium-24 are injected into the bloodstream to help locate obstructions to the flow of blood.

(credit: modification of work by “Blue0ctane”/Wikimedia Commons) Radioisotopes used in medicine typically have short half-lives—for example, the ubiquitous Tc-99m has a half-life of 6.01 hours. This makes Tc-99m essentially impossible to store and prohibitively expensive to transport, so it is made on-site instead. Hospitals and other medical facilities use Mo-99 (which is primarily extracted from U-235 fission products) to generate Tc-99. Mo-99 undergoes β decay with a half-life of 66 hours, and the Tc-99 is then chemically 2−; MoO4 (Figure 21.25). extracted The parent nuclide Mo-99 is part of a molybdate ion, when it decays, it −. TcO4 These two water-soluble ions are separated by column chromatography, with forms the pertechnetate ion, the higher charge molybdate ion adsorbing onto the alumina in the column, and the lower charge pertechnetate ion passing through the column in the solution. A few micrograms of Mo-99 can produce enough Tc-99 to perform as many as 10,000 tests. https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

Radiation therapy is the use (Figure of high-energy radiation to damage the DNA of cancer cells, which kills them or keeps them from dividing 21.26). A cancer patient may receive external beam radiation therapy delivered by a machine outside the body, or internal radiation therapy (brachytherapy) from a radioactive substance that has been introduced into the body. Note that chemotherapy is similar to internal radiation therapy in that the cancer treatment is injected into the body, but differs in that chemotherapy uses chemical rather than radioactive substances to kill the cancer cells. Figure 21.26 The cartoon in (a) shows a cobalt-60 machine used in the treatment of cancer. The diagram in (b) shows how the gantry of the Co-60 machine swings through an arc, focusing radiation on the targeted region (tumor) and minimizing the amount of radiation that passes through nearby regions.

The overall process is: 59 60 60 0 0 1 Co + n ⟶27 Co ⟶28 Ni + β + 20 γ 0 −1 27 Figure 21.27. The overall decay scheme for this is shown graphically in Figure 21.27 Co-60 undergoes a series of radioactive decays. The γ emissions are used for radiation therapy. Radioisotopes are used in diverse ways to study the mechanisms of chemical reactions in plants and animals. These include labeling fertilizers in studies of nutrient uptake by plants and crop growth, investigations of digestive and milk-producing processes in cows, and studies on the growth and metabolism of animals and plants. For example, the radioisotope C-14 was used to elucidate the details of how photosynthesis occurs. The overall reaction is: ⟶C6 H12 O6(s) + 6O2(g), 6CO2(g) + 6H2 O(l) but the process is much more complex, proceeding through a series of steps in which various organic compounds are produced. In studies of the pathway of this reaction, plants were exposed to CO2 containing a high concentration of 14 C . At regular intervals, the plants were analyzed to determine which organic compounds contained carbon-14 and 6 how much of each compound was present. From the time sequence in which the compounds appeared and the amount of each present at given time intervals, scientists learned more about the pathway of the reaction. (Figure 21.28). Commercial applications of radioactive materials are equally diverse They include determining the thickness of films and thin metal sheets by exploiting the penetration power of various types of radiation. Flaws in metals used for structural purposes can be detected using high-energy gamma rays from cobalt-60 in a fashion similar to the way X-rays are used to examine the human body. In one form of pest control, flies are controlled by sterilizing male flies with γ radiation so that females breeding with them do not produce offspring. Many foods are preserved by radiation that kills microorganisms that cause the foods to spoil. https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

The α emissions from Am-241 ionize the air between two electrode plates in the ionizing chamber. A battery supplies a potential that causes movement of the ions, thus creating a small electric current. When smoke enters the chamber, the movement of the ions is impeded, reducing the conductivity of the air. This causes a marked drop in the current, triggering an alarm. Figure 21.29 Inside a smoke detector, Am-241 emits α particles that ionize the air, creating a small electric current. During a fire, smoke particles impede the flow of ions, reducing the current and triggering an alarm. (credit a: modification of work by “Muffet”/Wikimedia Commons)

1218 Chapter 21 | Nuclear Chemistry 21.6 Biological Effects of Radiation By the end of this section, you will be able to: Describe the biological impact of ionizing radiation • Define units for measuring radiation exposure • Explain the operation of common tools for detecting radioactivity • List common sources of radiation exposure in the US • The increased use of radioisotopes has led to increased concerns over the effects of these materials on biological systems (such as humans). All radioactive nuclides emit high-energy particles or electromagnetic waves. When this radiation encounters living cells, it can cause heating, break chemical bonds, or ionize molecules. The most serious biological damage results when these radioactive emissions fragment or ionize molecules. For example, alpha and beta particles emitted from nuclear decay reactions possess much higher energies than ordinary chemical bond energies. When these particles strike and penetrate matter, they produce ions and molecular fragments that are extremely reactive. The damage this does to biomolecules in living organisms can cause serious malfunctions in (Figure normal cell processes, taxing the organism’s repair mechanisms and possibly causing illness or even death 21.30). Figure 21.30 Radiation can harm biological systems by damaging the DNA of cells. If this damage is not properly repaired, the cells may divide in an uncontrolled manner and cause cancer. Ionizing and Nonionizing Radiation There is a large difference in the magnitude of the biological effects of nonionizing radiation (for example, light and microwaves) and ionizing radiation, emissions energetic enough to knock electrons out of molecules (for example, (Figure 21.31). α and β particles, γ rays, X-rays, and high-energy ultraviolet radiation) https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

Chapter 21 | Nuclear Chemistry 1219 Figure 21.31 Lower frequency, lower-energy electromagnetic radiation is nonionizing, and higher frequency, higher- energy electromagnetic radiation is ionizing. Energy absorbed from nonionizing radiation speeds up the movement of atoms and molecules, which is equivalent to heating the sample. Although biological systems are sensitive to heat (as we might know from touching a hot stove or spending a day at the beach in the sun), a large amount of nonionizing radiation is necessary before dangerous levels are reached. Ionizing radiation, however, may cause much more severe damage by breaking bonds or removing electrons in biological molecules, disrupting their structure and function. The damage can also be done indirectly, by H2O+ first ionizing H2O (the most abundant molecule in living organisms), which forms a ion that reacts with water, forming a hydronium ion and a hydroxyl radical: Because the hydroxyl radical has an unpaired electron, it is highly reactive. (This is true of any substance with unpaired electrons, known as a free radical.) This hydroxyl radical can react with all kinds of biological molecules (DNA, proteins, enzymes, and so on), causing damage to the molecules and disrupting physiological processes. Figure 21.32. Examples of direct and indirect damage are shown in 

--- Page 1228 ---
1220 Chapter 21 | Nuclear Chemistry Figure 21.32 Ionizing radiation can (a) directly damage a biomolecule by ionizing it or breaking its bonds, or (b) H2O+ create an ion, which reacts with H2O to form a hydroxyl radical, which in turn reacts with the biomolecule, causing damage indirectly. Biological Effects of Exposure to Radiation Radiation can harm either the whole body (somatic damage) or eggs and sperm (genetic damage). Its effects are more pronounced in cells that reproduce rapidly, such as the stomach lining, hair follicles, bone marrow, and embryos. This is why patients undergoing radiation therapy often feel nauseous or sick to their stomach, lose hair, have bone aches, and so on, and why particular care must be taken when undergoing radiation therapy during pregnancy. (Figure 21.33). Different types of radiation have differing abilities to pass through material A very thin barrier, such as a sheet or two of paper, or the top layer of skin cells, usually stops alpha particles. Because of this, alpha particle sources are usually not dangerous if outside the body, but are quite hazardous if ingested or inhaled (see the Chemistry in Everyday Life feature on Radon Exposure). Beta particles will pass through a hand, or a thin layer of material like paper or wood, but are stopped by a thin layer of metal. Gamma radiation is very penetrating and can pass through a thick layer of most materials. Some high-energy gamma radiation is able to pass through a few feet of concrete. Certain dense, high atomic number elements (such as lead) can effectively attenuate gamma radiation with thinner material and are used for shielding. The ability of various kinds of emissions to cause ionization varies greatly, and some particles have almost no tendency to produce ionization. Alpha particles have about twice the ionizing power of fast-moving neutrons, about 10 times that of β particles, and about 20 times that of γ rays and X-rays. https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

Chapter 21 | Nuclear Chemistry 1221 Figure 21.33 The ability of different types of radiation to pass through material is shown. From least to most penetrating, they are alpha < beta < neutron < gamma. Chemistry in Everyday Life Radon Exposure For many people, one of the largest sources of exposure to radiation is from radon gas (Rn-222). Radon-222 is an α emitter with a half–life of 3.82 days. It is one of the products of the radioactive decay series of U-238 (Figure 21.9), which is found in trace amounts in soil and rocks. The radon gas that is produced slowly escapes from the ground and gradually seeps into homes and other structures above. Since it is about eight times more dense than air, radon gas accumulates in basements and lower floors, and slowly diffuses throughout buildings (Figure 21.34). 

--- Page 1230 ---
1222 Chapter 21 | Nuclear Chemistry Figure 21.34 Radon-222 seeps into houses and other buildings from rocks that contain uranium-238, a radon emitter. The radon enters through cracks in concrete foundations and basement floors, stone or porous cinderblock foundations, and openings for water and gas pipes. Radon is found in buildings across the country, with amounts depending on where you live. The average concentration of radon inside houses in the US (1.25 pCi/L) is about three times the levels found in outside air, and about one in six houses have radon levels high enough that remediation efforts to reduce the radon concentration are recommended. Exposure to radon increases one’s risk of getting cancer (especially lung cancer), and high radon levels can be as bad for health as smoking a carton of cigarettes a day. Radon is the number one cause of lung cancer in nonsmokers and the second leading cause of lung cancer overall. Radon exposure is believed to cause over 20,000 deaths in the US per year. Measuring Radiation Exposure Several different devices are used to detect and measure radiation, including Geiger counters, scintillation counters (Figure 21.35). radiation instrument, the Geiger (scintillators), and radiation dosimeters Probably the best-known counter (also called the Geiger-Müller counter) detects and measures radiation. Radiation causes the ionization of the gas in a Geiger-Müller tube. The rate of ionization is proportional to the amount of radiation. A scintillation counter contains a scintillator—a material that emits light (luminesces) when excited by ionizing radiation—and a sensor that converts the light into an electric signal. Radiation dosimeters also measure ionizing radiation and are often used https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

Figure 21.35 Devices such as (a) Geiger counters, (b) scintillators, and (c) dosimeters can be used to measure radiation. (credit c: modification of work by “osaMu”/Wikimedia commons) (Figure 21.36). A variety of units are used to measure various aspects of radiation The SI unit for rate of radioactive decay is the becquerel (Bq), with 1 Bq = 1 disintegration per second. The curie (Ci) and millicurie (mCi) are much 1010 × larger units and are frequently used in medicine (1 curie = 1 Ci = 3.7 disintegrations per second). The SI unit for measuring radiation dose is the gray (Gy), with 1 Gy = 1 J of energy absorbed per kilogram of tissue. In medical applications, the radiation absorbed dose (rad) is more often used (1 rad = 0.01 Gy; 1 rad results in the absorption of 0.01 J/kg of tissue). The SI unit measuring tissue damage caused by radiation is the sievert (Sv). This takes into account both the energy and the biological effects of the type of radiation involved in the radiation dose. The roentgen equivalent for man (rem) is the unit for radiation damage that is used most frequently in medicine (1 rem = 1 Sv). Note that the tissue damage units (rem or Sv) includes the energy of the radiation dose (rad or Gy) along with a biological factor referred to as the RBE (for relative biological effectiveness) that is an approximate measure of the relative damage done by the radiation. These are related by: number of rems = RBE × number of rads with RBE approximately 10 for α radiation, 2(+) for protons and neutrons, and 1 for β and γ radiation. Figure 21.36 Different units are used to measure the rate of emission from a radioactive source, the energy that is absorbed from the source, and the amount of damage the absorbed radiation does.

(source: U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission) A short-term, sudden dose of a large amount of radiation can cause a wide range of health effects, from changes in blood chemistry to death. Short-term exposure to tens of rems of radiation will likely cause very noticeable symptoms or illness; a dose of about 500 rems is estimated to have a 50% probability of causing the death of the victim within 30 days of exposure. Exposure to radioactive emissions has a cumulative effect on the body during a person’s lifetime, which is another reason why it is important to avoid any unnecessary exposure to radiation.

Although protons repel each other, the nucleus is held tightly together by a short-range, but very strong, force called the strong nuclear force. A nucleus has less mass than the total mass of its constituent nucleons. This “missing” mass is the mass defect, which has been converted into the binding energy that holds the nucleus together according to Einstein’s mass-energy equivalence mc2. equation, E = Of the many nuclides that exist, only a small number are stable. Nuclides with even numbers of protons or neutrons, or those with magic numbers of nucleons, are especially likely to be stable. These stable nuclides occupy a narrow band of stability on a graph of number of protons versus number of neutrons. The binding energy per nucleon is largest for the elements with mass numbers near 56; these are the most stable nuclei. 21.2 Nuclear Equations Nuclei can undergo reactions that change their number of protons, number of neutrons, or energy state. Many different particles can be involved in nuclear reactions. The most common are protons, neutrons, positrons (which are positively charged electrons), alpha (α) particles (which are high-energy helium nuclei), beta (β) particles (which are high-energy electrons), and gamma (γ) rays (which compose high-energy electromagnetic radiation). As with chemical reactions, nuclear reactions are always balanced. When a nuclear reaction occurs, the total mass (number) and the total charge remain unchanged. 21.3 Radioactive Decay Nuclei that have unstable n:p ratios undergo spontaneous radioactive decay. The most common types of radioactivity are α decay, β decay, γ emission, positron emission, and electron capture. Nuclear reactions also often involve γ rays, and some nuclei decay by electron capture. Each of these modes of decay leads to the formation of a new nucleus with a more stable n:p ratio. Some substances undergo radioactive decay series, proceeding through multiple decays before ending in a stable isotope. All nuclear decay processes follow first-order kinetics, and each radioisotope has its own characteristic half-life, the time that is required for half of its atoms to decay. Because of the large differences in stability among nuclides, there is a very wide range of half-lives of radioactive substances. Many of these substances have found useful applications in medical diagnosis and treatment, determining the age of archaeological and geological objects, and more. 21.4 Transmutation and Nuclear Energy It is possible to produce new atoms by bombarding other atoms with nuclei or high-speed particles. The products of these transmutation reactions can be stable or radioactive. A number of artificial elements, including technetium, astatine, and the transuranium elements, have been produced in this way. Nuclear power as well as nuclear weapon detonations can be generated through fission (reactions in which a heavy nucleus is split into two or more lighter nuclei and several neutrons). Because the neutrons may induce additional fission reactions when they combine with other heavy nuclei, a chain reaction can result. Useful power is obtained if the fission process is carried out in a nuclear reactor. The conversion of light nuclei into heavier nuclei (fusion) also produces energy. At present, this energy has not been contained adequately and is too expensive to be feasible for commercial energy production.

1232 Chapter 21 | Nuclear Chemistry 21.5 Uses of Radioisotopes Compounds known as radioactive tracers can be used to follow reactions, track the distribution of a substance, diagnose and treat medical conditions, and much more. Other radioactive substances are helpful for controlling pests, visualizing structures, providing fire warnings, and for many other applications. Hundreds of millions of nuclear medicine tests and procedures, using a wide variety of radioisotopes with relatively short half-lives, are performed every year in the US. Most of these radioisotopes have relatively short half-lives; some are short enough that the radioisotope must be made on-site at medical facilities. Radiation therapy uses high-energy radiation to kill cancer cells by damaging their DNA. The radiation used for this treatment may be delivered externally or internally. 21.6 Biological Effects of Radiation We are constantly exposed to radiation from a variety of naturally occurring and human-produced sources. This radiation can affect living organisms. Ionizing radiation is the most harmful because it can ionize molecules or break chemical bonds, which damages the molecule and causes malfunctions in cell processes. It can also create reactive hydroxyl radicals that damage biological molecules and disrupt physiological processes. Radiation can cause somatic or genetic damage, and is most harmful to rapidly reproducing cells. Types of radiation differ in their ability to penetrate material and damage tissue, with alpha particles the least penetrating but potentially most damaging and gamma rays the most penetrating. Various devices, including Geiger counters, scintillators, and dosimeters, are used to detect and measure radiation, and monitor radiation exposure. We use several units to measure radiation: becquerels or curies for rates of radioactive decay; gray or rads for energy absorbed; and rems or sieverts for biological effects of radiation. Exposure to radiation can cause a wide range of health effects, from minor to severe, and including death. We can minimize the effects of radiation by shielding with dense materials such as lead, moving away from the source, and limiting time of exposure. Exercises 21.1 Nuclear Structure and Stability 1.

Appendix B 1241 Appendix B Essential Mathematics Exponential Arithmetic Exponential notation is used to express very large and very small numbers as a product of two numbers. The first number of the product, the digit term, is usually a number not less than 1 and not greater than 10. The second number of the product, the exponential term, is written as 10 with an exponent. Some examples of exponential notation are: 103 1000 = 1 × 102 100 = 1 × 101 10 = 1 × 100 1 = 1 × 10−1 0.1 = 1 × 10−2 0.001 = 1 × 103 2386 = 2.386 × 1000 = 2.386 × 10−1 0.123 = 1.23 × 0.1 = 1.23 × The power (exponent) of 10 is equal to the number of places the decimal is shifted to give the digit number. The exponential method is particularly useful notation for every large and very small numbers. For example, 109, 10−10. × × 1,230,000,000 = 1.23 and 0.00000000036 Addition of Exponentials Convert all numbers to the same power of 10, add the digit terms of the numbers, and if appropriate, convert the digit term back to a number between 1 and 10 by adjusting the exponential term.

The last three figures of the number are obviously inaccurate, for during the time the keeper was counting the bees, some of them died and others hatched; this makes it quite difficult to determine the exact number of bees. It would have been more accurate if the beekeeper had reported the number 525,000. In other words, the last three figures are not significant, except to set the position of the decimal point. Their exact values have no meaning useful in this situation. In reporting any information as numbers, use only as many significant figures as the accuracy of the measurement warrants. The importance of significant figures lies in their application to fundamental computation. In addition and subtraction, the sum or difference should contain as many digits to the right of the decimal as that in the least certain of the numbers used in the computation (indicated by underscoring in the following example). Example B8 Addition and Subtraction with Significant Figures Add 4.383 g and 0.0023 g. Solution

Do not change the retained digit if the digits that follow are less than 5 (“round down”). If the retained digit is followed by 5, round up if the retained digit is odd, or round down if it is even (after rounding, the retained digit will thus always be even). The Use of Logarithms and Exponential Numbers The common logarithm of a number (log) is the power to which 10 must be raised to equal that number. For example, the common logarithm of 100 is 2, because 10 must be raised to the second power to equal 100. Additional examples follow.

To calculate a number from its 10x logarithm, take the inverse log of the logarithm, or calculate (where x is the logarithm of the number). The natural logarithm of a number (ln) is the power to which e must be raised to equal the number; e is the constant 2.7182818. For example, the natural logarithm of 10 is 2.303; that is, e2.303 2.71828182.303 10 = = To obtain the natural logarithm of a number, use the ln button on your calculator. To calculate a number from its ex natural logarithm, enter the natural logarithm and take the inverse ln of the natural logarithm, or calculate (where x is the natural logarithm of the number). Logarithms are exponents; thus, operations involving logarithms follow the same rules as operations involving exponents. The logarithm of a product of two numbers is the sum of the logarithms of the two numbers. 1. log xy = log x + log y, and ln xy = ln x + ln y The logarithm of the number resulting from the division of two numbers is the difference between the 2. logarithms of the two numbers. xy xy log = log x −log y, and ln = ln x −ln y The logarithm of a number raised to an exponent is the product of the exponent and the logarithm of the 3. number. xn xn log = nlog x and ln = nln x The Solution of Quadratic Equations Mathematical functions of this form are known as second-order polynomials or, more commonly, quadratic functions. ax2 + bx + c = 0 The solution or roots for any quadratic equation can be calculated using the following formula: b2 −b ± −4ac x = 2a Example B10 Solving Quadratic Equations 3x2 Solve the quadratic equation + 13x − 10 = 0.

1246 Appendix B Quadratic equations constructed on physical data always have real roots, and of these real roots, often only those having positive values are of any significance. Two-Dimensional (x-y) Graphing The relationship between any two properties of a system can be represented graphically by a two-dimensional data plot. Such a graph has two axes: a horizontal one corresponding to the independent variable, or the variable whose value is being controlled (x), and a vertical axis corresponding to the dependent variable, or the variable whose value is being observed or measured (y). When the value of y is changing as a function of x (that is, different values of x correspond to different values of y), a graph of this change can be plotted or sketched. The graph can be produced by using specific values for (x,y) data pairs.

Answer Key 1301 Answer Key Chapter 1 1.Place a glass of water outside. It will freeze if the temperature is below 0 °C. 3.(a) law (states a consistently observed phenomenon, can be used for prediction); (b) theory (a widely accepted explanation of the behavior of matter); (c) hypothesis (a tentative explanation, can be investigated by experimentation) 5.(a) symbolic, microscopic; (b) macroscopic; (c) symbolic, macroscopic; (d) microscopic 7.Macroscopic. The heat required is determined from macroscopic properties. 9.Liquids can change their shape (flow); solids can’t. Gases can undergo large volume changes as pressure changes; liquids do not. Gases flow and change volume; solids do not. 11.The mixture can have a variety of compositions; a pure substance has a definite composition. Both have the same composition from point to point. 13.Molecules of elements contain only one type of atom; molecules of compounds contain two or more types of atoms. They are similar in that both are comprised of two or more atoms chemically bonded together. 15.Answers will vary. Sample answer: Gatorade contains water, sugar, dextrose, citric acid, salt, sodium chloride, monopotassium phosphate, and sucrose acetate isobutyrate. 17.(a) element; (b) element; (c) compound; (d) mixture, (e) compound; (f) compound; (g) compound; (h) mixture 19.In each case, a molecule consists of two or more combined atoms. They differ in that the types of atoms change from one substance to the next. 21.Gasoline (a mixture of compounds), oxygen, and to a lesser extent, nitrogen are consumed. Carbon dioxide and water are the principal products. Carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxides are produced in lesser amounts. 23.(a) Increased as it would have combined with oxygen in the air thus increasing the amount of matter and therefore the mass. (b) 0.9 g 25.(a) 200.0 g; (b) The mass of the container and contents would decrease as carbon dioxide is a gaseous product and would leave the container.

Answer Key 1303 97.−33.4 °C, 239.8 K 99.113 °F Chapter 2 1.The starting materials consist of one green sphere and two purple spheres. The products consist of two green spheres and two purple spheres. This violates Dalton’s postulate that that atoms are not created during a chemical change, but are merely redistributed. 3.This statement violates Dalton’s fourth postulate: In a given compound, the numbers of atoms of each type (and thus also the percentage) always have the same ratio. 5.Dalton originally thought that all atoms of a particular element had identical properties, including mass. Thus, the concept of isotopes, in which an element has different masses, was a violation of the original idea. To account for the existence of isotopes, the second postulate of his atomic theory was modified to state that atoms of the same element must have identical chemical properties. 7.Both are subatomic particles that reside in an atom’s nucleus. Both have approximately the same mass. Protons are positively charged, whereas neutrons are uncharged. 9.(a) The Rutherford atom has a small, positively charged nucleus, so most α particles will pass through empty space far from the nucleus and be undeflected. Those α particles that pass near the nucleus will be deflected from their paths due to positive-positive repulsion. The more directly toward the nucleus the α particles are headed, the larger the deflection angle will be. (b) Higher-energy α particles that pass near the nucleus will still undergo deflection, but the faster they travel, the less the expected angle of deflection. (c) If the nucleus is smaller, the positive charge is smaller and the expected deflections are smaller—both in terms of how closely the α particles pass by the nucleus undeflected and the angle of deflection. If the nucleus is larger, the positive charge is larger and the expected deflections are larger—more α particles will be deflected, and the deflection angles will be larger. (d) The paths followed by the α particles match the predictions from (a), (b), and (c). 133Cs+; 127I−; 31P3−; 57Co3+ 11.(a) (b) (c) (d) 12C; 12C 13.(a) Carbon-12, (b) This atom contains six protons and six neutrons. There are six electrons in a neutral atom. The net charge of such a neutral atom is zero, and the mass number is 12. (c) The preceding answers are correct. (d) The atom will be stable since C-12 is a stable isotope of carbon. (e) The preceding answer is correct. Other answers for this exercise are possible if a different element of isotope is chosen. 6 6Li Li. 15.(a) Lithium-6 contains three protons, three neutrons, and three electrons.

Since there are three isotopes, there is no way to be sure to accurately predict the abundances to make the total of 20.18 amu average atomic mass. Let us guess that the abundances are 9% Ne-22, 91% Ne-20, and only a trace of Ne-21. The average mass would be 20.18 amu. Checking the nature’s mix of isotopes shows that the abundances are 90.48% Ne-20, 9.25% Ne-22, and 0.27% Ne-21, so our guessed amounts have to be slightly adjusted. 23.79.904 amu 25.Turkey source: 0.2649 (of 10.0129 amu isotope); US source: 0.2537 (of 10.0129 amu isotope) 27.The symbol for the element oxygen, O, represents both the element and one atom of oxygen. A molecule of oxygen, O2, contains two oxygen atoms; the subscript 2 in the formula must be used to distinguish the diatomic molecule from two single oxygen atoms. 29.(a) molecular CO2, empirical CO2; (b) molecular C2H2, empirical CH; (c) molecular C2H4, empirical CH2; (d) molecular H2SO4, empirical H2SO4

Chapter 5 1.The temperature of 1 gram of burning wood is approximately the same for both a match and a bonfire. This is an intensive property and depends on the material (wood). However, the overall amount of produced heat depends on the amount of material; this is an extensive property. The amount of wood in a bonfire is much greater than that in a match; the total amount of produced heat is also much greater, which is why we can sit around a bonfire to stay warm, but a match would not provide enough heat to keep us from getting cold. 3.Heat capacity refers to the heat required to raise the temperature of the mass of the substance 1 degree; specific heat refers to the heat required to raise the temperature of 1 gram of the substance 1 degree. Thus, heat capacity is an extensive property, and specific heat is an intensive one. °C−1; °C−1 5.(a) 47.6 J/°C; 11.38 cal (b) 407 J/°C; 97.3 cal 7.1310; 881 cal 9.7.15 °C 11.(a) 0.390 J/g °C; (b) Copper is a likely candidate. g/cm3(1 13.We assume that the density of water is 1.0 g/mL) and that it takes as much energy to keep the water at 85 °F as to heat it from 72 °F to 85 °F.

According to classical mechanics, the Rutherford model predicts a miniature “solar system” with electrons moving about the nucleus in circular or elliptical orbits that are confined to planes. If the requirements of classical electromagnetic theory that electrons in such orbits would emit electromagnetic radiation are ignored, such atoms would be stable, having constant energy and angular momentum, but would not emit any visible light (contrary to observation). If classical electromagnetic theory is applied, then the Rutherford atom would emit electromagnetic radiation of continually increasing frequency (contrary to the observed discrete spectra), thereby losing energy until the atom collapsed in an absurdly short time (contrary to the observed long-term stability of atoms). The Bohr model retains the classical mechanics view of circular orbits confined to planes having constant energy and angular momentum, but restricts these to quantized values dependent on a single quantum number, n. The orbiting electron in Bohr’s model is assumed not to emit any electromagnetic radiation while moving about the nucleus in its stationary orbits, but the atom can emit or absorb electromagnetic radiation when the electron changes from one orbit to another. Because of the quantized orbits, such “quantum jumps” will produce discrete spectra, in agreement with observations. 31.Both models have a central positively charged nucleus with electrons moving about the nucleus in accordance with the Coulomb electrostatic potential. The Bohr model assumes that the electrons move in circular orbits that have quantized energies, angular momentum, and radii that are specified by a single quantum number, n = 1, 2, 3, …, but this quantization is an ad hoc assumption made by Bohr to incorporate quantization into an essentially classical mechanics description of the atom. Bohr also assumed that electrons orbiting the nucleus normally do not emit or absorb electromagnetic radiation, but do so when the electron switches to a different orbit. In the quantum mechanical model, the electrons do not move in precise orbits (such orbits violate the Heisenberg uncertainty principle) and, instead, a probabilistic interpretation of the electron’s position at any given instant is used, with a mathematical function ψ called a wavefunction that can be used to determine the electron’s spatial probability distribution. These wavefunctions, or orbitals, are three-dimensional stationary waves that can be specified by three quantum numbers that arise naturally from their underlying mathematics (no ad hoc assumptions required): the

1312 Answer Key principal quantum number, n (the same one used by Bohr), which specifies shells such that orbitals having the same n all have the same energy and approximately the same spatial extent; the angular momentum quantum number l, which is a measure of the orbital’s angular momentum and corresponds to the orbitals’ general shapes, as well as specifying subshells such that orbitals having the same l (and n) all have the same energy; and the orientation quantum number m, which is a measure of the z component of the angular momentum and corresponds to the orientations of the orbitals. The Bohr model gives the same expression for the energy as the quantum mechanical expression and, hence, both properly account for hydrogen’s discrete spectrum (an example of getting the right answers for the wrong reasons, something that many chemistry students can sympathize with), but gives the wrong expression for the angular momentum (Bohr orbits necessarily all have non-zero angular momentum, but some quantum orbitals [s orbitals] can have zero angular momentum). 33. n determines the general range for the value of energy and the probable distances that the electron can be from the nucleus. l determines the shape of the orbital. m1 determines the orientation of the orbitals of the same l value with respect to one another. ms determines the spin of an electron. 35.(a) 2p; (b) 4d; (c) 6s 37.(a) 3d; (b) 1s; (c) 4f 39. 1 1 1 2, 2, 2; 41.(a) x. 2, y. 2, z. 2; (b) x. 1, y. 3, z. 0; (c) x. 4 0 0 y. 2 1 0 z. 3 2 0 (d) x. 1, y. 2, z. 3; (e) x. l = 0, ml = 0, y. l = 1, ml = –1, 0, or +1, z. l = 2, ml = –2, –1, 0, +1, +2 43.12 45. n l ml s 1 4 0 0 + 2 −1 4 0 0 2 1 4 1 −1 + 2 1 4 1 0 + 2 1 4 1 +1 + 2 −1 4 1 −1 2 Na+: 1s22s22p6; Ca2+: 1s22s22p6; Sn2+: 1s22s22p63s23p63d104s24p64d105s2; F–: 1s22s22p6; O2–: 47.For example, 1s22s22p6; Cl–: 1s22s22p63s23p6. https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

The C–C single bonds are longest. 75.(a) When two electrons are removed from the valence shell, the Ca radius loses the outermost energy level and reverts to the lower n = 3 level, which is much smaller in radius. (b) The +2 charge on calcium pulls the oxygen much closer compared with K, thereby increasing the lattice energy relative to a less charged ion. (c) Removal of the 4s electron in Ca requires more energy than removal of the 4s electron in K because of the stronger attraction of the nucleus and the extra energy required to break the pairing of the electrons. The second ionization energy for K requires that an electron be removed from a lower energy level, where the attraction is much stronger from the nucleus for the electron. In addition, energy is required to unpair two electrons in a full orbital. For Ca, the second ionization potential requires removing only a lone electron in the exposed outer energy level. (d) In Al, the removed electron is relatively unprotected and unpaired in a p orbital. The higher energy for Mg mainly reflects the unpairing of the 2s electron. 77.(d) 79.4008 kJ/mol; both ions in MgO have twice the charge of the ions in LiF; the bond length is very similar and both have the same structure; a quadrupling of the energy is expected based on the equation for lattice energy Na+ K+; 81.(a) Na2O; has a smaller radius than (b) BaS; Ba has a larger charge than K; (c) BaS; Ba and S have larger charges; (d) BaS; S has a larger charge 83.(e)

1322 Answer Key 85.The placement of the two sets of unpaired electrons in water forces the bonds to assume a tetrahedral arrangement, and the resulting HOH molecule is bent. The HBeH molecule (in which Be has only two electrons to bond with the two electrons from the hydrogens) must have the electron pairs as far from one another as possible and is therefore linear. 87.Space must be provided for each pair of electrons whether they are in a bond or are present as lone pairs. Electron-pair geometry considers the placement of all electrons. Molecular structure considers only the bonding-pair geometry. 89.As long as the polar bonds are compensated (for example. two identical atoms are found directly across the central atom from one another), the molecule can be nonpolar. 91.(a) Both the electron geometry and the molecular structure are octahedral.

Answer Key 1323 ; (c) ; 2−includes CS3 (d) three regions of electron density (all are bonds with no lone pairs); the shape is trigonal planar; CS2 has only two regions of electron density (all bonds with no lone pairs); the shape is linear 111. The Lewis structure is made from three units, but the atoms must be rearranged: 113. The molecular dipole points away from the hydrogen atoms. 115. The structures are very similar. In the model mode, each electron group occupies the same amount of space, so the bond angle is shown as 109.5°. In the “real” mode, the lone pairs are larger, causing the hydrogens to be compressed. This leads to the smaller angle of 104.5°. Chapter 8 1.Similarities: Both types of bonds result from overlap of atomic orbitals on adjacent atoms and contain a maximum of two electrons. Differences: σ bonds are stronger and result from end-to-end overlap and all single bonds are σ bonds; π bonds between the same two atoms are weaker because they result from side-by-side overlap, and multiple bonds contain one or more π bonds (in addition to a σ bond). 3.The specific average bond distance is the distance with the lowest energy. At distances less than the bond distance, the positive charges on the two nuclei repel each other, and the overall energy increases. 5.Bonding: One σ bond and one π bond. The s orbitals are filled and do not overlap. The p orbitals overlap along the axis to form a σ bond and side-by-side to form the π bond. 7.No, two of the p orbitals (one on each N) will be oriented end-to-end and will form a σ bond. 9.Hybridization is introduced to explain the geometry of bonding orbitals in valance bond theory.

Answer Key 1325 21. sp3 Phosphorus and nitrogen can form hybrids to form three bonds and hold one lone pair in PF3 and NF3, sp3d respectively. However, nitrogen has no valence d orbitals, so it cannot form a set of hybrid orbitals to bind five sp3d fluorine atoms in NF5. Phosphorus has d orbitals and can bind five fluorine atoms with hybrid orbitals in PF5. 23.A triple bond consists of one σ bond and two π bonds. A σ bond is stronger than a π bond due to greater overlap. 25.(a) sp3 (b) The terminal carbon atom uses hybrid orbitals, while the central carbon atom is sp hybridized.

Each of the four electrons is in a separate orbital and overlaps with an electron on an oxygen atom. 33.(a) Similarities: Both are bonding orbitals that can contain a maximum of two electrons. Differences: σ orbitals are end-to-end combinations of atomic orbitals, whereas π orbitals are formed by side-by-side overlap of orbitals. (b) Similarities: Both are quantum-mechanical constructs that represent the probability of finding the electron about the atom or the molecule. Differences: ψ for an atomic orbital describes the behavior of only one electron at a time based on the atom. For a molecule, ψ represents a mathematical combination of atomic orbitals. (c) Similarities: Both are orbitals that can contain two electrons. Differences: Bonding orbitals result in holding two or more atoms together. Antibonding orbitals have the effect of destabilizing any bonding that has occurred. 35.An odd number of electrons can never be paired, regardless of the arrangement of the molecular orbitals. It will always be paramagnetic. 37.Bonding orbitals have electron density in close proximity to more than one nucleus. The interaction between the bonding positively charged nuclei and negatively charged electrons stabilizes the system. 39.The pairing of the two bonding electrons lowers the energy of the system relative to the energy of the nonbonded electrons.

Chapter 9 1.The cutting edge of a knife that has been sharpened has a smaller surface area than a dull knife. Since pressure is force per unit area, a sharp knife will exert a higher pressure with the same amount of force and cut through material more effectively. 3.Lying down distributes your weight over a larger surface area, exerting less pressure on the ice compared to standing up.

Answer Key 1329 likely. Deviations occur with the conditions described in (a) and (c). Under conditions of (a), some gases may liquefy. Under conditions of (c), most gases will liquefy. 103.SF6 105.(a) A straight horizontal line at 1.0; (b) When real gases are at low pressures and high temperatures they behave close enough to ideal gases that they are approximated as such, however, in some cases, we see that at a high pressure and temperature, the ideal gas approximation breaks down and is significantly different from the pressure calculated by the van der Waals equation (c) The greater the compressibility, the more the volume matters. At low pressures, the correction factor for intermolecular attractions is more significant, and the effect of the volume of the gas molecules on Z would be a small lowering compressibility. At higher pressures, the effect of the volume of the gas molecules themselves on Z would increase compressibility (see Figure 9.35 ) (d) Once again, at low pressures, the effect of intermolecular attractions on Z would be more important than the correction factor for the volume of the gas molecules themselves, though perhaps still small. At higher pressures and low temperatures, the effect of intermolecular attractions would be larger. See Figure 9.35 . (e) low temperatures Chapter 10 1.Liquids and solids are similar in that they are matter composed of atoms, ions, or molecules. They are incompressible and have similar densities that are both much larger than those of gases. They are different in that liquids have no fixed shape, and solids are rigid. 3.They are similar in that the atoms or molecules are free to move from one position to another. They differ in that the particles of a liquid are confined to the shape of the vessel in which they are placed. In contrast, a gas will expand without limit to fill the space into which it is placed. 5.All atoms and molecules will condense into a liquid or solid in which the attractive forces exceed the kinetic energy of the molecules, at sufficiently low temperature. 7.(a) Dispersion forces occur as an atom develops a temporary dipole moment when its electrons are distributed asymmetrically about the nucleus. This structure is more prevalent in large atoms such as argon or radon. A second atom can then be distorted by the appearance of the dipole in the first atom. The electrons of the second atom are attracted toward the positive end of the first atom, which sets up a dipole in the second atom. The net result is rapidly fluctuating, temporary dipoles that attract one another (example: Ar). (b) A dipole-dipole attraction is a force that results from an electrostatic attraction of the positive end of one polar molecule for the negative end of another polar molecule (example: ICI molecules attract one another by dipole-dipole interaction). (c) Hydrogen bonds form whenever a hydrogen atom is bonded to one of the more electronegative atoms, such as a fluorine, oxygen, nitrogen, or chlorine atom. The electrostatic attraction between the partially positive hydrogen atom in one molecule and the partially negative atom in another molecule gives rise to a strong dipole-dipole interaction called a hydrogen bond HF⋯HF).

Chloroethane, however, has rather large dipole interactions because of the Cl-C bond; the interaction is therefore stronger, leading to a higher boiling point. 15.−85 °C. Water has stronger hydrogen bonds so it melts at a higher temperature. 17.The hydrogen bond between two hydrogen fluoride molecules is stronger than that between two water molecules because the electronegativity of F is greater than that of O. Consequently, the partial negative charge on F is greater than that on O. The hydrogen bond between the partially positive H and the larger partially negative F will be stronger than that formed between H and O. N −H and 19.H-bonding is the principle IMF holding the DNA strands together.

1330 Answer Key 23.The water molecules have strong intermolecular forces of hydrogen bonding. The water molecules are thus attracted strongly to one another and exhibit a relatively large surface tension, forming a type of “skin” at its surface. This skin can support a bug or paper clip if gently placed on the water. 25.Temperature has an effect on intermolecular forces: the higher the temperature, the greater the kinetic energies of the molecules and the greater the extent to which their intermolecular forces are overcome, and so the more fluid (less viscous) the liquid; the lower the temperature, the lesser the intermolecular forces are overcome, and so the less viscous the liquid. 27.(a) As the water reaches higher temperatures, the increased kinetic energies of its molecules are more effective in overcoming hydrogen bonding, and so its surface tension decreases. Surface tension and intermolecular forces are directly related. (b) The same trend in viscosity is seen as in surface tension, and for the same reason. 10−5 × m 29.9.5 31.The heat is absorbed by the ice, providing the energy required to partially overcome intermolecular attractive forces in the solid and causing a phase transition to liquid water. The solution remains at 0 °C until all the ice is melted. Only the amount of water existing as ice changes until the ice disappears. Then the temperature of the water can rise. 33. We can see the amount of liquid in an open container decrease and we can smell the vapor of some liquids. 35.The vapor pressure of a liquid decreases as the strength of its intermolecular forces increases. 37.As the temperature increases, the average kinetic energy of the molecules of gasoline increases and so a greater sufficient energy to escape from the liquid than at lower temperatures. fraction of molecules have 39. When the pressure of gas above the liquid is exactly 1 atm 41.approximately 95 °C 43.(a) At 5000 feet, the atmospheric pressure is lower than at sea level, and water will therefore boil at a lower temperature. This lower temperature will cause the physical and chemical changes involved in cooking the egg to slowly, and a longer time is required to fully cook the egg. (b) As long as the air surrounding the body proceed more contains less water vapor than the maximum that air can hold at that temperature, perspiration will evaporate, thereby cooling the body by removing the heat of vaporization required to vaporize the water. 45. Dispersion forces increase with molecular mass or size. As the number of atoms composing the molecules in this homologous series increases, so does the extent of intermolecular attraction via dispersion forces and, consequently, the energy required to overcome these forces and vaporize the liquids. The boiling point of CS2 is higher than that of CO2 partially because of the higher molecular weight of CS2; 47. consequently, the attractive forces are stronger in CS2. It would be expected, therefore, that the heat of vaporization would be greater than that of 9.8 kJ/mol for CO2. A value of 28 kJ/mol would seem reasonable. A value of −8.4 kJ/ mol would indicate a release of energy upon vaporization, which is clearly implausible. The thermal energy (heat) needed to evaporate the liquid is removed from the skin. 49. 51.1130 kJ 53.(a) 13.0 kJ; (b) It is likely that the heat of vaporization will have a larger magnitude since in the case of vaporization the intermolecular interactions have to be completely overcome, while melting weakens or destroys only some of them. 55.At low pressures and 0.005 °C, the water is a gas. As the pressure increases to 4.6 torr, the water becomes a solid; as the pressure increases still more, it becomes a liquid. At 40 °C, water at low pressure is a vapor; at torr, it converts into a liquid. At −40 °C, water goes from a gas to a solid as the pressures higher than about 75 pressure increases above very low values. 57.

These intermolecular forces are of comparable strength and thus require the same amount of energy to overcome. As a result, ice melts at a single temperature and not over a range of temperatures. The various, very large molecules that compose butter experience varied van der Waals attractions of various strengths that are overcome at various temperatures, and so the melting process occurs over a wide temperature range. 69.(a) ionic; (b) covalent network; (c) molecular; (d) metallic; (e) covalent network; (f) molecular; (g) molecular; (h) ionic; (i) ionic 71.X = ionic; Y = metallic; Z = covalent network 73.(b) metallic solid 75.The structure of this low-temperature form of iron (below 910 °C) is body-centered cubic.

Colloidal particles are either very large molecules or aggregates of smaller species that usually are big enough to scatter light. Colloids are homogeneous on a macroscopic (visual) scale, while solutions are homogeneous on a microscopic (molecular) scale. 75.If they are placed in an electrolytic cell, dispersed particles will move toward the electrode that carries a charge opposite to their own charge.

If the reaction is endothermic the heat added can be thought of as a reactant. Additional heat would shift an exothermic reaction back to the reactants but would shift an endothermic reaction to the products. Cooling an exothermic reaction causes the reaction to shift toward the product side; cooling an endothermic reaction would cause it to shift to the reactants' side. 35.No, it is not at equilibrium.

CH3 NH3 are (CH3)2NH and 39.triethylamine. −; HSO4 41.(a) higher electronegativity of the central ion. (b) H2O; NH3 is a base and water is neutral, or decide on the basis of Ka values. (c) HI; PH3 is weaker than HCl; HCl is weaker than HI. Thus, PH3 is weaker than HI. (d) PH3; in binary compounds of hydrogen with nonmetals, the acidity increases for the element lower in a group. (e) HBr; in a period, the acidity increases from left to right; in a group, it increases from top to bottom. Br is to the left and below S, so HBr is the stronger acid. 43.(a) NaHSeO3 < NaHSO3 < NaHSO4; in polyoxy acids, the more electronegative central element—S, in this case—forms the stronger acid. The larger number of oxygen atoms on the central atom (giving it a higher oxidation state) also creates a greater release of hydrogen atoms, resulting in a stronger acid. As a salt, the acidity increases in −< −< −; ClO2 BrO2 IO2 the basicity of the anions in a series of acids will be the opposite the same manner. (b) of the acidity in their oxyacids. The acidity increases as the electronegativity of the central atom increases. Cl is more electronegative than Br, and I is the least electronegative of the three. (c) HOI < HOBr < HOCl; in a series of the same form of oxyacids, the acidity increases as the electronegativity of the central atom increases. Cl is more electronegative than Br, and I is the least electronegative of the three. (d) HOCl < HOClO < HOClO2 < HOClO3; in a series of oxyacids of the same central element, the acidity increases as the number of oxygen atoms increases (or HTe−< HS−<< −< −and −are −; PH2 PH2 NH2 NH2 as the oxidation state of the central atom increases). (e) HTe−and HS−are H+. anions of weak acids, so they have anions of weak bases, so they act as strong bases toward less basic character. In a periodic group, the more electronegative element has the more basic anion. (f) −< −< −< BrO−; BrO4 BrO3 BrO2 with a larger number of oxygen atoms (that is, as the oxidation state of the central ion increases), the corresponding acid becomes more acidic and the anion consequently less basic. [H+] OH(CO2)−] H)−] [OH−] [H2 O] > [C6 H4 OH(CO2 H)] > 0 > [C6 H4 ≫[C6 H4 O(CO2 > 45. 47.Strong electrolytes are 100% ionized, and, as long as the component ions are neither weak acids nor weak bases, the ionic species present result from the dissociation of the strong electrolyte. Equilibrium calculations are necessary when one (or more) of the ions is a weak acid or a weak base. 49.1. Assume that the change in initial concentration of the acid as the equilibrium is established can be neglected, so this concentration can be assumed constant and equal to the initial value of the total acid concentration. 2. H3O+. Assume we can neglect the contribution of water to the equilibrium concentration of 51.(b) The addition of HCl H3O+ OH−ions, 53.(a) Adding HCl will add ions, which will then react with the lowering their concentration. The equilibrium will shift to the right, increasing the concentration of HNO2, and decreasing the concentration of −ions. NO2 (b) Adding HNO2 increases the concentration of HNO2 and shifts the equilibrium to the left, −ions OH−ions. NO2 increasing the concentration of and decreasing the concentration of (c) Adding NaOH adds −ions OH−ions, NO2 which shifts the equilibrium to the left, increasing the concentration of and decreasing the concentrations of HNO2. (d) Adding NaCl has no effect on the concentrations of the ions. (e) Adding KNO2 adds −ions OH−ion NO2 and shifts the equilibrium to the right, increasing the HNO2 and concentrations. 55.This is a case in which the solution contains a mixture of acids of different ionization strengths. In solution, the HCO2H exists primarily as HCO2H molecules because the ionization of the weak acid is suppressed by the strong acid. Therefore, the HCO2H contributes a negligible amount of hydronium ions to the solution. The stronger acid, HCl, is the dominant producer of hydronium ions because it is completely ionized. In such a solution, the stronger [H3O+] acid determines the concentration of hydronium ions, and the ionization of the weaker acid is fixed by the produced by the stronger acid. https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at

The conclusion we can make is that the probability for all the particles to stay in only one part of the system will decrease rapidly as the number of particles increases, and, for instance, the probability for all molecules of gas to gather in only one side of a room at room temperature and pressure is negligible since the number of gas molecules in the room is very large. 11.There is only one initial state. For the final state, the energy can be contained in pairs A-C, A-D, B-C, or B-D.

1356 Answer Key 65.ΔG is negative as the process is spontaneous. ΔH is positive as with the solution becoming cold, the dissolving must be endothermic. ΔS must be positive as this drives the process, and it is expected for the dissolution of any soluble ionic compound.

Alternatively, battery reaction byproducts accumulate and interfere with the reaction. Because a fuel cell is constantly resupplied with reactants and products are expelled, it can continue to function as long as reagents are supplied. 41. Ecell, as described in the Nernst equation, has a term that is directly proportional to temperature. At low temperatures, this term is decreased, resulting in a lower cell voltage provided by the battery to the device—the same effect as a battery running dead. 43.Mg and Zn 45.Both examples involve cathodic protection. The (sacrificial) anode is the metal that corrodes (oxidizes or reacts). In the case of iron (−0.447 V) and zinc (−0.7618 V), zinc has a more negative standard reduction potential and so serves as the anode. In the case of iron and copper (0.34 V), iron has the smaller standard reduction potential and so corrodes (serves as the anode). 47.While the reduction potential of lithium would make it capable of protecting the other metals, this high potential is also indicative of how reactive lithium is; it would have a spontaneous reaction with most substances. This means that the lithium would react quickly with other substances, even those that would not oxidize the metal it is attempting to protect. Reactivity like this means the sacrificial anode would be depleted rapidly and need to be replaced frequently.

Answer Key 1363 attraction of the oxygen electron results in a stronger attraction of oxygen for the electrons in the O-H bond, making the hydrogen more easily released. The weaker this bond, the stronger the acid. 89.As H2SO4 and H2SeO4 are both oxyacids and their central atoms both have the same oxidation number, the acid strength depends on the relative electronegativity of the central atom. As sulfur is more electronegative than selenium, H2SO4 is the stronger acid. sp2 sp2, sp3, 91.SO2, 4+; SO3, 6+; H2SO4, 6+ 93.SF6: S = 6+; SO2F2: S = 6+; KHS: S = 2− 95.Sulfur is able to form double bonds only at high temperatures (substantially endothermic conditions), which is not the case for oxygen. 97.There are many possible answers including: + SO2(g) + 2H2 O(l) Cu(s) + 2H2 SO4(l) ⟶CuSO4(aq) + 2H2 O(l) C(s) + 2H2 SO4(l) ⟶CO2(g) + 2SO2(g) 104 × 99.5.1 g 101.SnCl4 is not a salt because it is covalently bonded.

1368 Answer Key ; (c) C5H8 3.Both reactions result in bromine being incorporated into the structure of the product. The difference is the way in which that incorporation takes place. In the saturated hydrocarbon, an existing C–H bond is broken, and a bond between the C and the Br can then be formed. In the unsaturated hydrocarbon, the only bond broken in the hydrocarbon is the π bond whose electrons can be used to form a bond to one of the bromine atoms in Br2 (the electrons from the Br–Br bond form the other C–Br bond on the other carbon that was part of the π bond in the starting unsaturated hydrocarbon). 5.Unbranched alkanes have free rotation about the C–C bonds, yielding all orientations of the substituents about these bonds equivalent, interchangeable by rotation. In the unbranched alkenes, the inability to rotate about the C = C bond results in fixed (unchanging) substituent orientations, thus permitting different isomers. Since these concepts pertain to phenomena at the molecular level, this explanation involves the microscopic domain. 7.They are the same compound because each is a saturated hydrocarbon containing an unbranched chain of six carbon atoms. 9.(a) C6H14 ; (b) C6H14 ; (c) C6H12 ; https://cnx.org/content/col11760/1.9 This content is available for free at
